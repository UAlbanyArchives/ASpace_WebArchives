              "content": "The group that would become the Saratoga Springs Open Space Project (OSP) came together loosely in 1987. Its purpose was to help the city develop an open space supplement to the 1987 Saratoga Springs Master Plan. The OSP organized as an offshoot of the Saratoga Institute, a not-for-profit educational organization directed by Barbara Glaser. The OSP officially formed a board of directors in 1990. It produced the Open Space Plan, its vision for a \"City in the Country\" in 1991.\n\n The Open Space Plan included 24 recommendations for the preservation of historic, natural, and rural spaces as wells as landmarks in the city of Saratoga Springs. It was widely distributed through presentations and open meetings. In 1993, the plan was revised and formally published through a grant provided by Rural New York's Environmental Action Fund. The Saratoga Springs City Council adopted the plan in 1994. The OSP continued to develop the plan and the Council unanimously accepted its updated form in 2002.\n\n The Open Space Project continued to work for the preservation of open space in Saratoga Springs. The OSP supported the creation of nature trails, scenic walkways, and biking paths through programs like the ISTEA Rails to Trails program. Working with funds obtained through donations and grants, the OSP helped create the Bog Meadow Brook Nature Trail, Spring and Railroad Run Trails, Ramsdill Park, Ten Springs Woods Park, and a forty-seven mile looping recreational trail system throughout the city of Saratoga Springs.\n\n The OSP has also vigorously opposed sprawl and loss of open space by organizing opposition to unsustainable development. One such campaign was the OSP's opposition to the construction of a truck bypass through the southern section of Saratoga Spa State Park. This opposition included the \"Undiscovered Park\" exhibit, an exhibition of art inspired by the State Park. Other campaigns include an opposition to a quarry near the Petrified Sea Gardens and protecting the rural character of the Exit 14 city entranceway against the development of an office park.\n\n In addition, the OSP has helped coordinate several programs aimed at aiding the development of Saratoga Springs. The OSP maintained a special interest in the development of the downtown area, with projects like The Next Steps &amp; Beyond forum and the Broadway Square mini-mall forum. These forums brought together people from all areas of Saratoga Springs to help generate ideas for the creative revitalization of the downtown.\n\n Throughout its existence, Barbara Glaser has held executive positions in the OSP, starting as the temporary chairperson and continuing as co-chair of the advisory board. There has been a succession of fellow co-chairs, including Jeff Olsen, Douglas Ward, and Sally Hart Brown. The OSP maintained a small paid professional staff, including a Project Director and Newsletter Editor, and in 1998 hired Alain Ball Chinian as Executive Director. In 2003, the Saratoga Springs Open Space Project merged with the Land Trust of the Saratoga Region to form Saratoga PLAN (Preserving Land And Nature.) Thus the OSP no longer exists as a separate organization. Saratoga PLAN maintains a website at http://www.saratogaplan.org/.\n\n There has been some confusion about the relations of the OSP to other organizations due to similar names and goals. The Saratoga Springs Open Space Project is not connected to the Open Space Institute, a statewide organization that also seeks to preserve scenic and natural landscape. However, the OSP has received grant funding from the Open Space Institute for trail building. The Saratoga Institute is a non-profit educational institute founded in 1985, in Saratoga Springs. It works through projects, like the OSP, the Humor Project, and The Association for the Cooperative Advancement of Science and Education. It is not related to the Sagamore Institute or the Human Resource Analysis organization also called the Saratoga Institute.",

              "content": "Alvin Bernard Ford (1953-1991) was convicted of first-degree murder in the slaying of a police officer in a failed robbery attempt in Florida on July 21, 1974. Ford entered prison at the age of 20 and was sentenced to die by electrocution in two separate criminal proceedings. He remained on death row until his death of natural causes on February 28, 1991 at the age of 37. \n\n Ford was fighting depression and a drug addiction when he became involved in a robbery attempt at a Red Lobster restaurant in Ft. Lauderdale Florida in 1974. Ford's three accomplices left him at the scene with police approaching. In a panicked state, Ford chose to escape by taking the car of a police officer who was not aware of the severity of the situation when he arrived alone. Ford shot the officer twice in the abdomen and once in the back of the head while retrieving the officer's car keys. After being apprehended at his mother's home in Gainesville, Florida, Ford spent his first six years in prison under normal health conditions. In late 1981, at the end of the appeals process and within hours of his execution, Ford's mental condition deteriorated dramatically. For the next nine years he moved in and out of schizophrenia, which finally developed into sustained psychosis by the time his second death warrant was signed in 1984.\n\n The Alvin Ford case was lengthy in part because of the questions that had not been answered adequately until his case was brought before the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court's verdict in the Ford case brought stricter guidelines than previously existed for determining if someone is mentally fit to defend himself in trial and whether the mentally ill should receive the death penalty. Capital punishment experts Kent S. Miller and Michael L. Radelet have written of the impact the Ford v. Wainwright decision had on the treatment of mentally ill prisoners on death row saying, \"Alvin Ford made history as the man who forced the criminal justice authorities, lawyers, judges, politicians, mental heath professionals, and a host of others to seriously debate the question of what types of mental illness should exempt condemned prisoners from execution and how (and by whom) these life-and-death determinations should be made,\" according to Kent Millar and Michael Radelet, in their book, <emph render=\"italic\">Executing the Mentally Ill: The Criminal Justice System and the Case of Alvin Ford</emph>\n\n The legal process of taking Ford's capital punishment case from arrest to execution in Florida involved many opportunities for him to appeal to circuit courts of appeal, the U.S. and Florida Supreme Courts, and the governor. After Ford's arrest on July 21, 1974, he was tried in December 1974, sentenced in early 1975, and after appeals to the Supreme Courts of Florida and the United States, received his first death warrant signed by Governor Bob Graham on November 4, 1981. The scheduled execution date was December 8, 1981. Fourteen hours before the scheduled execution Ford was granted a stay of execution by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. After further psychiatric evaluations, the governor's committee decided he was competent for execution and signed his second death warrant on April 30, 1984 with a scheduled execution date of May 31, 1984. Once again, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals stepped in fourteen hours before Ford's scheduled execution and granted another stay of execution. When Ford's case was brought before the United States Supreme Court, it ruled on June 26, 1986 that the Eighth Amendment prohibits states from inflicting the death penalty upon prisoners who are insane and found that Florida's procedures for determining sanity had failed to adequately protect Ford's rights. Ford's sanity was not decided, however, and this led to a trial in early 1989 that found Ford competent for execution. The decision by a subsequent appeal to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals was never passed down because Ford was found dead in his cell due to adult respiratory distress syndrome associated with fulminant acute pancreatitis on February 2, 1991.\n\n The Ford case occurred at a time in the history of capital punishment in the United States of a resurgence in a get-tough-on-crime attitude embraced by politicians who pointed, in part, to their stand on the death penalty as evidence that they were tough on crime. This period began during the Nixon administration with some critical changes in the legal system that made capital punishment legal once again in the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in the Ford case set an important precedent since, up until the case, there were no clear-cut protections shielding the mentally ill from execution. The ruling took the final decision out of an individual governor's hands through clemency hearings and placed it within the court system.",

              "content": "This collection documents the seventeen year period (1974-1991) concerning the Florida capital punishment case of Alvin Ford. The collection primarily contains the court records and research material of Ford's attorney, Laurin A. Wollan, Jr., as well as other members of the Ford defense team who began work on the case in 1981. The legal records include official court proceedings from the initial trial in 1974, appeals, attempts at clemency, and several cases by Ford against the Florida Department of Corrections. Other legal records include psychological reports, background reports, biographies of Ford, as well as his prison and medical records.\n\n Several participants are represented in the collection over the case's duration. Robert Adams represented Ford from his initial trial until his appeal to the Florida Supreme Court was denied on July 18, 1979. A community organizer from the Florida Clearing House on Criminal Justice, Scharlette Holdman, located a volunteer lawyer, Deborah Fins, to represent Ford in his petition for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court and continued to consult for the Ford case over the next 10 years. After his certiorari case was denied, Holdman and Deborah Fins recruited a more experienced lawyer, Laurin A. Wollan, to represent Ford in his 1981 clemency hearings. Wollan took the case pro bono and continued to work on Ford's behalf over the next 10 years. Wollan was a 1962 graduate of the University of Chicago Law School. He served as a state's attorney in Illinois, spent four years with the U.S. Department for Justice, and was a member of the Florida State University faculty beginning in 1976. Although he was a death penalty supporter and a former prosecutor, his compassion for Ford's circumstance led him to accept the case on a pro bono basis. The size and scope of the files he created reveal Wollan's efforts on Ford's behalf, for example, as Ford's clemency hearing quickly approached in mid-1981, he was without legal representation. Wollan was asked to take the case and over the next six weeks, from August through October, he worked solely on the Ford case as he struggled to acquaint himself with the details of the case. Attorney Richard Burr joined Wollan in volunteering to represent Ford just as Ford's first execution approached in 1981. Both remained on the Ford case until his death. A number of state officials are found throughout the case's legal documents including: Florida Governor Bob Graham who had the power to grant clemency to Ford; circaE. \"Sonny\" Strickland who was superintendent of the Florida State Prison; and Louie Wainwright and Richard Dugger who were Secretaries of the Department of Corrections for the State of Florida.\n\n Ford's attorneys collected many articles, pamphlets, and publications on the subject of the death penalty. The research material in this collection represents many organizations, most of which oppose the death penalty. These include the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, National Coalition Against the Death Penalty, ACLU, Florida Clearing House on Criminal Justice, Amnesty International, Institute for Southern Studies, Florida Citizens Against the Death Penalty, and the Florida Conference Against Death Penalty. The collection also reveals the sentiment of these anti-death penalty groups during a time of resurgent support for the death penalty. The news clippings are a comprehensive part of the research material covering many death penalty cases in Florida spanning two decades.\n\n The collection contains court records from at least six specific trials and many other appeals and motions that, besides chronicling the case, demonstrate one of the arguments which many anti-death penalty advocates utilize, that a death penalty case costs more than a sentence of life imprisonment. The collection is strongly enhanced by a separate collection of news clippings that directly relate to the Ford case. These news clippings are very helpful in understanding how the case developed.\n\n While the collection contains a variety of records covering not only the legal aspects of the case, but also Ford himself, and presents a thorough example of the nature of representing a death penalty defendant, it is understandably limited to death penalty issues as they relate to the state of Florida. The implications, however, of the Supreme Court ruling on the Ford case in 1986, that a mentally ill prisoner cannot be executed and the resultant change in Florida and other states' laws concerning the process of identifying mentally ill prisoners, is what makes this collection so valuable.\n\n Additional material for the Alvin Ford Collection was received from Michael Radelet in January 2006. This material is not yet inventoried in this finding aid.\n\n Related collections in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives can be found at the web site for the National Death Penalty Archive.",

It maintained eight chapters representing individual campuses as well as a central office at the Social Justice Center in Albany. Campus Action was led by David Easter, the founder and coordinator, and a board of directors. The campus chapters in the Capital Region, including the University at Albany, possessed considerable autonomy.\n\n The primary goal of Campus Action was to increase progressive activism on college campuses and build cooperation between campus and community activist groups. To this end, it produced a number of publications, including guidebooks for organizing, specific issue guides on racism and sexism, and directories of activist groups. Its most regular publication was the<emph render=\"italic\">Campus Action News</emph> newsletter, an update of activities and events, published three times a year. Campus Action offered internships to students interested in working for an activist organization and published an <emph render=\"italic\">Alternative Internship Directory</emph> that directed students to other organizations. In addition, Campus Action sponsored and organized a number of events including a biannual organizing conference for a variety of causes, workshops, protests, and demonstrations.\n\n In April of 2006, David Easter announced that he was stepping down as coordinator of Campus Action and closing the central office. This meant that publication of Campus Action News would cease and the website would no longer be maintained, but the individual campus chapters would continue to function.",

These materials include minutes, correspondence, publications, grant applications, webpages, fliers, leaflets and other handouts. The collection holds material from the Campus Action central office and does not contain material specific to the individual chapters of Campus Action.\n\n Campus Action created a number of publications for campus distribution. These include the newsletter<emph render=\"italic\">Campus Action News</emph>, two study guides, and directories of local activist organizations and internships. These are all well represented in the collection, along with materials from the biannual conferences held to help organize activism, primarily as paper documents with some additional later material in electronic form. There is a lack of records from 2000 when David Easter was on hiatus and, for example, there were no issues of <emph render=\"italic\">Campus Action News</emph> produced.\n\n The central office collected a great deal of material on issues of interest to Campus Action, including acquaintance rape, racism, war protest, feminism, and civil liberties. The paper materials deal heavily with the issue of date rape and sexual harassment on campus, while the more extensive electronic files include more recent material on a wider variety of topics. All electronic records were reformatted to Printable Document Format (PDF) files and can be viewed with Adobe Acrobat Reader.\n\n Campus Action's opposition to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq is particularly well documented in the electronic records, with related defenses of detainees in the civil rights and racism sections. The case of Ali Yaghi is also documented in the electronic records. Yaghi, an Albany resident and owner of a pizza shop, was arrested just days after 9/11. He was detained on the basis of a tip by a passerby, who claimed to have heard Yaghi making anti-American statements. Yaghi was detained for months and though eventually cleared of all allegations related to terrorism, he was deported to his native Jordan because of his immigration status.",

              "content": "Ralph F. Boyd, Sr. is a lifelong social justice advocate well known for his commitment to civil rights, equality, civil service and local community activism within Schenectady, New York. Born in 1919 in Norfolk, V.A, and raised in Baltimore M.D, Boyd grew up in the segregated south during a time when discrimination and racism plagued many northern and southern communities. Although there were occasional hardships, the support and importance of family, along with the community of church, acted as Boyd\u2019s savior. He credits both components for instilling strong moral values within him. \n\n  Upon graduating from Frederick Douglass High School, Boyd continued his education by attending Morgan College, now Morgan State University, in Baltimore. He was able to complete two years before World War II disrupted his college life. While serving in the U.S. Army, he was part of the all black (segregated) 366 Infantry Regiment that would later go on to be recognized and honored for its performance during the war. \n\n Despite the fact that Boyd, and many other African-Americans, were willing to fight in the war for the cause of democracy and protection of their country, the reception these skilled veterans received upon returning home was not a welcoming one. Boyd returned home, realized that nothing had changed and was concerned. \n\n  Discontented with the status quo of society, following the war efforts abroad, Boyd decided that he would work to effect change. His first target would be the General Electric Co., a company which previously denied him employment when he first inquired about a job soon after the war. Boyd was told that he didn\u2019t have the training to fulfill a position within the company in spite of his skilled experience in the U.S. Army. General Electric eventually began to hire African-Americans in 1948, including Boyd, but this would not be the end of the trouble that Boyd would endure, nor would it be the end of other problems that he noticed. Not only were African-Americans being treated unfairly, women were being treated unequally as well. Boyd began to defend his female co-workers who were not being paid the same as the men. Despite the obstacles placed forth, Boyd remained within General Electric. He would eventually become a prominent spokesperson and leader for the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers (IUE) Local 301 union as well as the foreman in the Turbine-Generator Department. He continued working for General Electric for 34 years, up until his retirement in 1982.\n\n In addition to campaigning for change within General Electric, Ralph Boyd also worked within the local community of Schenectady to advocate change for the social, political and economic conditions for African-Americans. Noted for his local community activism, he was elected as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1968. Possessing both the passion and eagerness to see everybody within society treated equally, alongside his interest in community activities, Boyd, in company with friends and colleagues, established and developed the Schenectady chapter of the NAACP in 1950. Serving as the chapter\u2019s president for several terms, in addition to undertaking the responsibility of each post within the organization during his years of involvement, Boyd promoted and supported initiatives for reform change in areas surrounding the housing \u201cslums\u201d within Schenectady. These initiatives include, but were not limited to, acquiring affordable housing for low income groups and improving the conditions within the slums to make the surroundings acceptable for proper living. In addition to his focus on housing, Boyd also campaigned for equality within education and was instrumental in the establishment of the Baptist Retirement Center in 1977. The Baptist Retirement Center, which is located in Scotia, New York, provides activities and medical care for seniors and is the result of Boyd\u2019s desire to see a nursing home within the local community that would facilitate care for those elderly in need.\n\n As a social justice advocate, Ralph Boyd\u2019s work within the Schenectady community is both acknowledged and highly praised. He has won numerous awards, one which identified him as a Schenectady Patroon in 2008, an award that is the city\u2019s equivalent to the Nobel Prize. General Electric named him a winner of the Gerald L. Phillippe Award for Distinguished Public Service in 1978.\n\n  The information provided above was gleaned from the following sources, in addition to those found in the Ralph F. Boyd Sr. Papers themselves:",

She was involved substantially with the League of Women Voters (LWV), serving on its New York State Board and working for the Albany County chapter of the organization. Donovan had a long-term interest in environmental issues and was noted for her efforts in passing the New York State Bottle Bill, which included a well-publicized walk from Buffalo to Albany to raise awareness of the issues. She worked as a lobbyist for the LWV at the state level, frequently supporting environmental issues. In addition, she was a Legislative Representative for the Adirondack Mountain Club from 1986 to 1990.\n\n Water and air quality were central among Donovan's environmental interests and she was a member of Albany County's Water Quality Coordinating Committee. In 1986, she gave testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works about acid rain issues. Donovan, a Guilderland resident, died on August 26, 2003. At the time, she was survived by husband Robert A. Donovan, a professor in the Department of English at the University at Albany.",

The collection spans the years 1970 to 2003. The vast majority of the materials are concerned with environmental issues in New York State. The most prominent single subject is water resources, particularly watersheds and groundwater. Other prominent subjects are the Adirondack Park, development issues, and the Smart Growth Conferences from 1999 to 2001. Materials of note include a folder on New York State's Bottle Bill, in which Donovan played a crucial role, and materials related to Guilderland (where Donovan resided), including town history, planning, and land use.\n\n Most of the collection consists of publications, reports, conference proceedings, guides, and papers. There are also some memos and correspondence. Original signatures are rather infrequent, however. Most of the material was not written by Donovan herself, although it does include scattered handwritten notes. It is almost entirely concerned with the various environmental and civic activities connected to Donovan's career, rather than with her personal papers. Generally, the only materials that diverge from the kind of formats mentioned earlier are several maps and plans, related to the Adirondack Park in particular, and a film entitled \"A Salute to Garbage.\"",

Mitchell continued to head the society into the early 1970s, at which point Harriet Dryer Adams officially assumed the position of president until 1976. A formal constitution was established during the mid-1970s, describing procedures for electing officers and holding meetings, which were subsequently used in nominating Wayne Somers as the society\u2019s next president in 1977. The Society of Bibliophiles arranged and attended meetings and lectures pertaining to book collecting, papermaking, book binding, as well as various authors and books. The group also began its annual tradition of a year-end Wayzegoose party in 1970, at which members gather for dinner and discussion of books.\n\n Presidents of the society and the approximate dates of their terms are as follows: Harriet Dryer Adams (1970-1976), Wayne Somers (1977-1980), Sydney Ross (1981-1982), Arnold Elkind (1983-1984), Bruce Northrup (1985-1987), Ellen Fladger (1988-1991), Christine Bain (1992, 1994-2001), and Michael Aikey (1993).",

The Administrative series contains general administrative documents generated and accumulated by the society during its regular activities. This series contains a file containing records for every year from 1966 to 1991, as well as for 2001-2002. Reflecting a change in the society\u2019s recordkeeping processes, the Subject Folder series consists of folders referring to specific processes or types of records, including announcements, member materials, newsletters, and clippings. This series contain records dating from 1967 to 2002, although the bulk of the material falls between 1991 and 2000.",

              "content": "Henry Sackett Manley was born in Smith Mills in western New York on January 29, 1892. He died September 14, 1967, in Lakeland, Florida.[2] Manley graduated from Northwestern University College of Law in 1916. In 1917-1918, he was a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Corps, becoming an instructor for pilots going into bomber assignments. From 1920 to 1924, Manley practiced law in Jamestown, NY, where he became a partner in the firm Jackson, Manley and Herrick.[3] \n\n From 1925 to 1928, Manley served as an attorney in the Office of the Attorney General, New York State. He argued cases in the appellate courts, including the New York Court of Appeals. The family has a letter from the famous judge Benjamin Cardozo, of the Court of Appeals, complimenting Manley on his advocacy (Cardozo later served on the U.S. Supreme Court, but was best known for his opinions written as a Court of Appeals judge). \n\n From 1931 to 1936, Manley was Counsel to the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. He was a key figure in developing the New York State Milk Control Board. This involved a system which was intended to assure concerned parties that farmers, as well as grocers would receive a fair price and that milk would reach consumers, including mothers who needed it for their babies. Previously there was a crisis when farmers were distraught over low prices for their milk during which milk trucks had been overturned and the State Police were involved. The Milk Control Board and the related milk control system were designed to end this crisis and apparently did so satisfactorily. Manley defended the former milk control system in the U.S. Supreme Court in Nebbia v. New York, decided in 1934 (reported in 291 U.S. 502). The case, which is considered a landmark Supreme Court decision, is utilized in constitutional law casebooks in law schools. \n\n From 1936 to 1942, Manley was a partner in the law practice of Staley, Tobin and Manley, 100 State Street, Albany, NY. Also during this period he had his own practice, with offices at Green Valley Farm, RFD Strykersville, NY, as well as Syracuse and Albany. He and his wife Dorothy owned a 300 acre farm which they named Green Valley Farm. The farm, on what is now called Manley Road, Town of Bennington, Wyoming County was located about 30 miles East of Buffalo. It was cited as a \"Century Farm\" by the New York State Agricultural Society, having been in Dorothy Manley's family since about 1830. Dorothy French Manley's forbearer, Pomeroy Warren, received title to this land from the Holland Land Company in about 1830.\n\n From 1943 until his retirement in 1955, Manley worked in the New York State Department of Law in Albany. As an Assistant Attorney General in the Appeals and Opinions Bureau, he argued many cases in the U.S. Supreme Court, and even more in the New York State Court of Appeals. In 1955, he became Solicitor General under Jacob Javits, who had been elected Attorney General in November 1954 in a contest with Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr. The Solicitor General, who serves directly under the Attorney General, is responsible for overseeing appeals and opinions in the Department of Law. \n\n Manley's book, <emph render=\"italic\">The Treaty of Fort Stanwix, 1784</emph> was published in 1932 by the Rome Sentinel Publishing Company, Rome, NY. Previously, little had been written about this important treaty. It involved commissioners on behalf of the United States meeting in October 1784 with six Indian nations on the site of the ruined fort where Rome, NY is now situated. Manley conducted research over a 5-6 year period, utilizing sources in Canada, the Harvard College Library, the Library of Congress, the New York City Public Library, the New York Historical Society, and elsewhere. He also published numerous articles in the journal of the New York State Historical Association regarding Indians and Indian law, including \"Red Jacket's Last Campaign.\" He published \"Buying Buffalo from the Indians\" in the journal of the Buffalo Historical Society. \n\n His articles in the <emph render=\"italic\">Cornell Law Quarterly</emph> (now known as <emph render=\"italic\">Cornell Law Review</emph>) included \"Mr. Justice Per Curiam.\" Widely read and admired, the Lawyers Cooperative Publishing Company, Rochester, NY, re-published the article in its nationally distributed journal, <emph render=\"italic\">Case and Comment</emph>. The article dealt with an imaginary judge who Henry Manley placed humorously, and also in a serious vein, as the author of hundreds of court decisions that were signed \"Per Curiam\" (meaning \"for the court\"). By studying such decisions (a laborious research task), he was able to conclude that they were often the product of courts which did not want to come up with a decision ascribed to a particular judge or judges (as for instance in politically charged cases involving the interpretation of election laws). Another article, published in the <emph render=\"italic\">Albany Law Review</emph> under the title \"Nebbia Plus Fifteen,\" revisited the famous Nebbia U.S. Supreme Court case. His study, the \"Manley Family: New England and New York 1650-1950,\" a forty-two page work based upon considerable research over a period of years, was completed in October 1965, two years before his death. Numerous letters of his were also published in the <emph render=\"italic\">New York Times</emph>. \n\n As an Assistant Attorney General in the New York State Department of Law, Manley represented the Shinnecock Indians (Suffolk County, Long Island) in successfully fighting off developers who coveted land the tribe claimed. In 1939, he represented Hattie Charles, who asserted she was an Indian, in a legal matter (U.S. v. Hattie Charles). There were conflicting positions on whether New York State or federal law applied. In question was ownership of a piece of land, probably including a house, and probably located on an Indian reservation. Henry Manley was in private practice at this time. It appears he took on the case <emph render=\"italic\">pro bono</emph> since Hattie Charles was apparently without funds. \n\n Based upon his reputation as a specialist in New York State Indian law in about 1956, Manley was retained by the New York State Power Authority to research and advise regarding litigation that went to the U.S. Supreme Court. The litigation involved the question of whether or not the Power Authority could obtain title (by condemnation-for which compensation would be paid) to land owned by the Tuscarora Tribe. The Power Authority asserted the need to utilize this land to build a reservoir as part of a major power- generating project near Niagara Falls, NY. The Authority was successful in obtaining title to the land. \n\n Henry Manley was a long-standing member of the Constitutional Law Committee of the New York State Bar Association. He was appointed by the Governor of New York as a member of the Letchworth State Park Commission in 1959 and continued serving probably until his death in 1967. Letchworth is a very large State park in western New York. Part of it was in Wyoming County, the county where Green Valley Farm was located, where Manley lived after retiring from the New York State Department of Law in 1955. Manley was a member of the Wyoming County Republican Committee from about 1957 to 1962. He was an Adjunct Professor at the University of Buffalo Law School (now part of the State University of New York at Buffalo) during the spring semester in 1948.\n\n Footnotes:\n\n [1] Information regarding Henry S.

Roosevelt), an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, and Chief U.S. Prosecutor in the Nuremberg war crimes trials. For more on Jackson, see Eugene C. Gerhart's biography of him, <emph render=\"italic\">America's Advocate</emph>, published in 1958 by the Bobbs-Merrill Co., Inc, Indianapolis, Indiana.",

Another strength is a fair amount of research material that relates to Manley's book, <emph render=\"italic\">The Treaty of Fort Stanwix, 1784</emph>. The Legal Papers Series is not close to comprehensive concerning Manley's legal career. The volume of material from approximately 1930 to1950, in particular, is rather small. Nevertheless, the collection does include a good sampling of the cases with which he was involved. The Personal Papers Series is quite small, as this is not the focus of the collection. \n\n About one half of the material originally transferred to the Department consisted of published material, most of which Manley presumably used for research. Much of it has been separated from the collection and is being added to the book collection of the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives or the University at Albany Libraries. A complete list of publications is available from the Department of Special Collections and Archives. The items already cataloged can be searched in Minerva, the University at Albany Libraries' online catalog. \n\n Related collections in the M.E.

A majority of the material belonged to Winnie Brandt, the former President of the Transgender Independence Club, also known as TGIC. Brandt, along with other transgender community members, produced as well as collected a large number of local, regional, and national publications. The TGIC and TVIC were two local transgender groups based in Albany New York. TGIC was founded in 1971, and at the time was the only membership organization in the Albany area for transgender people where enrollment stayed confidential. TGIC held weekly social gatherings for transgender people to socialize with other transgender people or partake in discussion about issues affecting the transgender community. Unfortunately the club was disbanded in the early 2000s due to much conflict within the group. A group similar to TGIC was the Albany Gender Project, founded in 2001 by Susan Poe and Helen Farrell. The project worked to improve the conditions for transgender people in the Capital Region as well as promote and advocate educational services for them. The Albany Gender Project also hosted bimonthly meetings where members held forums, listened to guest speakers, and were connected to the social services they needed.\n\n For the transgender community, this collection shows \"how we've been a real community with a collective life and traditions and continuity. It shows what our issues have been, what we keep rehashing, what works, what doesn't, and who the personalities have been and how they've helped the community.\" (Taken from the final issue of <emph render=\"italic\">Trannies in Love</emph>).",

Mr. Bonowitz corresponded with inmates as a part of his work to end the death penalty in the United States as well as improve death row conditions. He was successful in acquiring fans for all death row inmates in Florida. \n\n As a campaign strategist, Mr. Bonowitz works with statewide organizations also seeking to end the death penalty in their state. Among the statewide abolition organizations, Mr. Bonowitz was the Director of Affiliate Support and much of his work from this period is documented in series six.

He has provided commentary on the death penalty on The Today Show, CNN, Court TV, The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, and other major television news programs. Hawkins was selected as a Next Generation Leadership Fellow by the Rockefeller Foundation and received the Thurgood Marshall Award from the Bar Association of New York for his advocacy on behalf of persons under sentence of death. His profession affiliations include the National Conference of Black Lawyers and the Center for International Studies at New York University, where he served on the board of trustees [Open Society Institute and Soros Foundations Network, \"Past Events: OSI Forum: Supreme Decisions -- Re-Thinking the Death Penalty\", http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice/events/deathpenalty_20020718/event_biography_folder_initiative_view Accessed 14 September 2006].\n\n The National Coalition Against the Death Penalty was started in 1976 and is a national organization dedicated to providing advocacy for inmates and other people affected by death penalty laws, such as families of prisoners and victims. The National Coalition Against the Death Penalty seeks to provide information to community members on death penalty issues, legal help for inmates to have their sentences either commuted or exonerated, encouragement for the media to provide accurate coverage of the death penalty, analysis and lobbying for legislative bodies to encourage them to abolish the death penalty, assisting local death penalty groups in their efforts and encouraging the global community to abolish the death penalty. The National Coalition Against the Death Penalty believes that the death penalty should be abolished based on four principles: that capital punishment denies the dignity and worth of every human being by preventing them from personal repentance and transformation, that capital punishment is irreversible but frequently fallible (as seen through DNA evidence), that capital punishment is consistently applied with racial and class prejudices against the defendants, and that capital punishment is a basic violation of international human rights laws.

The papers contain meeting subject files that include extensive minutes of board meetings, speeches, fundraising, reception notes, pamphlets, and other papers relating to his attendance at various board and committee meetings with related organizations, such as the Death Penalty Information Center and Amnesty International. The papers also contain copies of police reports, witness and investigator statements, and defendant testimony regarding the cases of certain high-profile death row inmates, such as Mumia Abu-Jamal, Delma Banks Jr., Wilburn Dobbs, Reginald Clemons, Clarence Allen Lackey, T. Makawanyane and Mchunu, Kenneth Reams. and Keith Versie. These inmate files were retained by Steven Hawkins and his staff in order to provide legal advocacy in court hearings to obtain commutation, clemency, or exoneration for these inmates.\n\n The papers lack full biographical information about Mr. Hawkins, with the exception of a few mentions of his wife Wanda and details about his previous experience as a lawyer in Washington, D.C. The papers give many biographical details about the death row inmates included and some detail about some of the witnesses and investigators. Other than the founding date of the National Coalition Against the Death Penalty, no details exist in these papers as to the organization's general history before the mid-1990s, when Hawkins joined the staff.",

The chapter serves the Capital Region including Albany, Rensselaer, and Schenectady Counties. The National Organization for Women was founded in 1966 and has maintained its position on bringing equality to all women. Albany Area NOW belongs to a larger community whose main objective is to eliminate discrimination in the work place, school, the justice system, and all sectors of society. \n\n The Albany chapter was one of the first local chapters in the State of New York to be in full operation (January 1972). From the time of its organization in the Capital Region, the chapter has made an effort to ensure woman have the same privileges and responsibilities as men within American society. There were originally plans to establish a chapter in the Capital Region in 1967, but there were financial setbacks in the state chapter that initially prevented the chapter's organization. The Albany chapter flourished quickly and was fortunate to have several leaders, including Sue Stevens Larsen, Pauline Brundage, and Jeanne Dross, who worked to build a strong foundation. These members occupied positions in the local and state NOW organizations. At various times in its history, the Albany chapter also served as the central office for NOW New York State. \n\n NOW has been an advocate of reproductive rights and believes that reproductive issues are a matter of life and death for women. NOW also has supported educational opportunities for women, the ERA (Equal Rights Amendment), equal pay for women, gay and lesbian rights, rape prevention, and other key issues.",

He became a member of the New York State Assembly in 1939 and in 1958 he left office to run for lieutenant governor on the ticket with Nelson A. Rockefeller. Wilson\u2019s first run for public office was in 1938 when he was elected to the State Assembly from Yonkers. Wilson was re-elected to the Assembly for nine additional terms from a predominantly Democratic district. As a member of the State Assembly, he introduced 1,250 bills of which 432 were passed in both houses of the legislature and signed by the governor. One of the more significant bills to be passed was the creation of the Higher Education Assistance Corporation providing for a state guaranteed loan program for students attending public or private colleges. Wilson served as lieutenant governor under Nelson Rockefeller until Rockefeller\u2019s resignation in 1973. Rockefeller recognized Wilson as the man who pushed for revenue sharing as well as working with local and state government. Wilson served as governor from 1973 through 1974.\n\n On June 1, 1974, Wilson delivered a speech on his candidacy to run for governor, stating: \u201cWhat I am and have been throughout my public service: progressive in meeting human needs and conservative in handling the people\u2019s tax dollars.\u201d Wilson ran for governor in 1975, but lost the election to Hugh Carey of Brooklyn. After retirement from political life, Wilson served as CEO of Manhattan Saving Banks. Wilson died on March 13, 2000.",

The collection includes a selection of speeches and addresses by Wilson. Wilson\u2019s swearing in address as the 50th governor of New York State is one of the highlights of the collection.\n\n Wilson\u2019s work with the Women\u2019s National Republican Club is documented in the collection. Wilson was a strong supporter of women\u2019s rights. He emphasized that as a Republican, he was committed to the rights and freedoms of individuals. The collection also includes transcripts of press conferences from 1973-1974. Also included is the transcript of a press conference regarding the Watergate Scandal in which Wilson commented on the president, the nation, and his thoughts about how the situation was handled.\n\n The remarks folder includes the remarks of Governor Wilson on the issues of the day. Some of the more interesting documents relate to Wilson\u2019s work in Harlem and the erection of a state office building in uptown Manhattan. Wilson believed that this was a historic moment because of the participation of African Americans in a state government project.\n\n Wilson\u2019s remarks when announcing his candidacy for the governorship of New York in 1974 is also in the collection. In the press conference transcript, Wilson is questioned about his campaign and his preparations for the upcoming election. Wilson discusses the needs of New York State and the state budget which he wanted to divide between local and state government. Wilson was also questioned about ethnic groups and minorities in New York City and he responded by stating that he was not concerned about political affiliation or race, but rather the job he was doing for the people of New York.\n\n The New York State budget is always a cause for concern in order to balance the needs of the citizens of New York. One of Rockefeller\u2019s and Wilson\u2019s main concerns was the increased taxation in New York State and the services which needed to be provided for the people of New York. Along with Assembly Speaker Perry Duryea, Wilson attempted to make sure that New Yorkers were getting their tax dollars back in through public services.\n\n News clippings are also a vital part of the collection. In this section of the collection you can find articles related to Malcolm Wilson and his initiatives. One of the news clippings is a New York Times article discussing Rockefeller\u2019s work that Wilson continued after he assumed the position of governor.\n\n In this collection you will also find Wilson\u2019s message to the Legislature from 1974, in which he addresses the needs of New York State. He cited the energy crisis and improving the administration of justice as areas in need of improvement.\n\n Related collections in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives can be found at the Subject Guides for the New York State Modern Political Archive and Public Servants and Politicians.",

              "content": "Born in Albany as Michelle DeMarco, Michelle Crone was a notable driving force in the lesbian and women\u2019s movements both at the local and national level for almost 30 years. Her long career as a grassroots activist and organizer focused primarily on internal cooperation and rumor control within the various activism movements she was involved in. An interest in theater and film led her to producing performances within the women\u2019s festivals of the 1980s and the establishment of her own Albany-based production company, Elword Productions. Crone became a national leader in the lesbian political activist movement, serving important roles with both the 1987 and 1993 national marches, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, an as a central leader of the National Lesbian Conference of 1991.\n\n Michelle DeMarco graduated from Albany\u2019s Vincentian School in 1968 and immediately volunteered for the anti-poverty VISTA program. She served as a welfare rights worker in the Blue Ridge Mountains and helped to establish a crisis intervention network and other social programs in the Virgin Islands. She attended the College of the Virgin Islands for a period where she studied anthropology and sociology.\n\n During much of the 1970s, DeMarco was spending half her years in St. Thomas and half in the Albany area. In 1972 she joined the Capital District group Lesbians for Liberation, a radical feminist organization that heavily influenced the local women\u2019s movement. By the mid-1970s, DeMarco was a member of a variety of separatist feminist collectives in the Adirondacks and Vermont, such as A Women\u2019s Place in Athol, New York, Crone Hill in Hoag\u2019s Corners, New York, and Redbird near Burlington, Vermont. In 1976 she began to go by Michelle Crone and helped start Gypsy Silver, a collectively-owned and operated business that provided vegetarian catering, taxi, and general handyman (or handywomen) services.\n\n Crone became involved with large women\u2019s festivals beginning with the Michigan Womyn\u2019s Festival in 1979. She would directly contribute to the organization of over 25 festivals throughout her career. She became interested in solving internal conflict and in the development of effective communalist approaches to organization and the decision-making processes. Throughout the 1980s Crone continued her involvement with the Michigan festival and also served as coordinator for Robin Tyler\u2019s Southern Women\u2019s Music ? Comedy Festival and West Coast Music ? Comedy Festival, and helped lead the Full Circle Festival: Equinox \u201989 at the end of the decade.\n\n Crone was admitted into the State University of New York at Albany through the Educational Opportunities Program (EOP) in the fall of 1981. She majored first in theatre, yet also fulfilled interests in film, women\u2019s studies, and anthropology. She graduated with honors 1986 with a degree in film history and anthropology and later became a mentor in the Women\u2019s Studies Internship Program, helping dozens of young women gain experience in activist movements.\n\n In 1983, Crone became a central organizer of the Seneca Women\u2019s Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice, again helping to define the group\u2019s communal structure and organizational process. The encampment aimed to build a representative and diverse community with a non-hierarchical decision-making process and provide a safe, legal space for civil disobedience actions. They demanded a halt to the deployment of nuclear missiles abroad and camped outside the Seneca Army Depot near Romulus, New York, which was the rumored nuclear storage site and staging-ground for the export of nuclear weaponry to Europe. Crone was the first staff member and received $200 a week to coordinate logistics, manage donations and permits, assist with office and media work, and manage orientation for new women. The encampment was active from 1983 until at least 1987, performing a variety of civil disobedience actions that included symbolic candlelight vigils and \u201cpeace puzzles\u201d outside the depot\u2019s main gate to chaining themselves to the fence, sneaking inside the fence to plant trees, and even camping on the depot\u2019s runway. One planned action proposed to place a symbolic condom (a bed sheet) on a model missile just inside the base. Members of the encampment were arrested by military police multiple times, and the group often conflicted with the local populace and police.\n\n With her contacts developed during her time a numerous festivals, Crone started Elword Productions in 1986, and for the next decade the company brought nationally known feminist, lesbian, and gay performers to the Capital District. Acts included comedian and lesbian activist Robin Tyler\u2014who worked with Crone at a number of festivals\u2014and JEB (Joan E. Biron), a photojournalist and documentarian filmmaker who attended the Seneca Women\u2019s Encampment. Elword also produced future lesbian activist and Grammy award winner Mellissa Etheridge in the late 1980s when Etheridge charged $200 a show to play in Albany.\n\n By 1986, gay men and lesbians felt they were under political threat across the nation. The AIDS crisis was growing disproportionally within gay communities and the discomfort with homosexuality in popular political discourse led to the marginalization of the crisis and strong accusations that Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration was ignoring and underfunding health organizations and research into the disease. Gay men and lesbians began to witness calls for forced testing and concentration camp-like quarantines for gay men in popular discourse. Moreover, in 1986 the Supreme Court ruled in <emph render=\"italic\">Bowers v. Hardwick</emph> that a Georgia sodomy law was constitutional. The case was particularly offensive to gay men and lesbians because it featured police impropriety and the act in question was consensual and took place in the defendant\u2019s bedroom. In the ruling, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger cited ancient prohibitions to homosexuality \u2013 effectively arguing that gay sex was illegal in any context.\n\n This feeling of external threat and the deaths of many gay men due to AIDS, radicalized the gay and lesbian activist movements. In early 1987 the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) was started in New York City and Michelle Crone joined the movement\u2019s Albany chapter. Plans began to circulate for a national march on Washington and Crone\u2019s experience with grassroots activism, logistics and organizational structure, and civil disobedience made her a candidate for a leadership role. Furthermore, her advocacy for a variety of leftist causes meshed well with the movement\u2019s attempt at progressive coalition-building. The theme of the March was \u201cFor Love and For Life, We\u2019re Not Going Back!\u201d and the movement demanded legal representation of homosexual relationships, repeal of sodomy laws, the banning of discrimination by sexual orientation, a gay civil rights bill, money for AIDS research and health centers, and progressive pro-choice and anti-apartheid causes.\n\n Crone became involved during the March\u2019s early stages, serving on the planning committees for hiring, legal, and logistics. She became a member of the New York Regional Committee and was then elected as the region\u2019s representative to the National Steering Committee. Here she helped manage merchandise sales, budget, health, media, on-site logistics, and the organization of PWA (People with AIDS) groups. Most notably, Crone was selected at the National Civil Disobedience Coordinator for the March and managed the action at the Supreme Court to protest the <emph render=\"italic\">Bowers</emph> ruling. The structure of the C.D. action was akin to that of Crone\u2019s earlier groups, with activists divided up into \u201caffinity groups\u201d each with a heath monitor and spokesperson that represented the group\u2019s interests to the larger spokescouncil that make decisions. With the theme \u201cOut and Outraged: Love, Life, Liberation,\u201d between 650 and 850 activists were arrested on October 13th, 1987 on the steps of the Supreme Court, making the demonstration the second-largest act of Civil Disobedience in the nation\u2019s history. The action established nonviolent civil disobedience as a viable protest tactic for the gay and lesbian activist movement.\n\n In 1986, Michelle Crone attended an international conference of lesbians in Geneva, Switzerland where she became disappointed at the coordination of American lesbians at the national level and she began advocating for a national conference. In 1989 she organized a National Planning Meeting in Durham, North Carolina to coordinate a conference that would discuss and implement a national lesbian agenda and foster a unified national lesbian movement with a common vision. Crone chaired the Entertainment Committee and the Structure/Process Committee and again implemented a collectivist organization that was driven by consensus and prioritized minority representation. For two years the Interim National Office was essentially Crone\u2019s kitchen in Albany. In 1991 the National Lesbian Conference was held in Atlanta, Georgia, where lesbians of color made up 50% of representatives and lesbians with disabilities constituted 20%.\n\n By the late 1980s, Crone grew dissatisfied with the organization of women\u2019s festivals. Together with Kathleen Mahoney, Susan Fuchs, Barbara Savage, and Mandy Carter began <emph render=\"italic\">Rhythm Fest: Women\u2019s Music Art ? Politics</emph>, an annual humanist/progressive women\u2019s festival that ran from 1990 until 1996. The festivals were women-only affairs with some men tolerated only for maintenance work. Again Crone was process-focused and made efforts to manage internal dissent and cooperation. She instituted \u201crumor control\u201d as a process and often solicited feedback and evaluations from workers and attendees. Rhythm Fest also focused on the recognition of minority groups and featured special camping areas for women over 40, disabled women, women with children, \u201cchem-free,\u201d \u201cchem-tolerant,\u201d clean ? sober, S?, biker girls, quiet women, and rowdy women. Like similar festivals, Rhythm Fest sometimes had issues with public nudity, with an incident forcing the festival to move from Georgia to North Carolina.\n\n Crone became involved with the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a lobby group, during the late 1980s. She served on the host committee for the 1991 Creating Change Conference and served as the NGLTF\u2019s grassroots organizer for the upcoming 1993 National March on Washington. Crone was also involved in organizing the 1993 march during its early stages, serving as a member of the Interim Coordinating Committee. For this march she was elected to both the large National Steering Committee and to the 12-member Executive Committee, and served on the Outreach and Communication/Media Subcommittees. Her title with the NGLTF was updated to March on Washington Coordinator where she managed outreach and merchandizing for the lobby group, as well as directed their marketing plan, ran a canvassing campaign, and produced NGLTF march events and activities. Locally, Crone managed the transportation of the New York AIDS Memorial Quilt to Albany and the addition of names from the Capital District.\n\n In 1994, Crone was selected as Events Coordinator for the Cultural Festival at Gay Games IV in New York City which was held on the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. Gay Games is an athletic and cultural festival that began in 1982 features LGBT athletes, artists, and entertainers. Gay Games IV boasted over 10,000 athletes, more than those that competed in either 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona or the 1996 Games in Atlanta. The athletes competed in a number of locations around the city, from college pools and city recreation centers to Central Park. Michelle Crone directed the Cultural Festival which included performances by LGBT entertainers such as Ian McKellen and Robin Tyler.\n\n Crone continued her activist efforts into the mid-1990s. She spoke at various pride parades and rallies and joined the Gay ? Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). Locally, she had been a member of the New York State Lesbian ? Gay Lobby, where she was charged with local community organizing, since the late 1980s. When that group evolved into the Empire State Pride Agenda in 1994 she was appointed to its Board of Directors.",

              "content": "Helen Quirini (1920-2010) was a lifelong resident of Schenectady, New York. She was known for her dedication to numerous causes, such as organized labor, the YWCA of Schenectady, gender and racial equality, social welfare, and local activism. Although Quirini focused primarily on the Capital Region, she also worked for statewide and national causes. She advocated the repeal of the Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 and participated in the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. During her 39 year employment at General Electric (GE) and her 30 year retirement, Quirini advocated for the better treatment of employees and retirees by the management of GE.\n\n Born March 9, 1920 to Marie Ogonowski and Frank K. Quirini, Helen Quirini was the youngest of four children and attended Mont Pleasant High School. On April 1, 1941, at the age of 21, Quirini began working for GE's Schenectady plant doing piece work in the factory. The United States' entrance into World War II interrupted her initial plan to save money in order to attend college. Quirini decided to work at GE throughout the war as a service to her country. By 1945 she had established a pattern of union leadership and community activism that continued for the rest of her life.\n\n At General Electric she joined the Athletic Board, advocated for equal treatment for female employees and organized drives for the local Red Cross. She joined a union, Local 301, which was first affiliated with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (UE) and later, beginning in 1954, with the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (IUE). Quirini held many executive leadership positions with Local 301, served on numerous labor committees, was a union shop steward and regularly attended union conferences and conventions. Quirini was a vocal force for employee rights, both in boardroom meetings with GE executives and during strikes, protests and work stoppages. In 1953 Quirini mobilized mass protests to advocate for equal pay for women workers at GE. She walked picket lines in all types of weather in support of union solidarity. While employed at GE and as a member of Local 301, Quirini achieved a number of firsts. In 1953, she became the first woman elected chairperson of the special UE-GE Conference Board Meeting, held that year in Chicago. Quirini also was the first woman and hourly representative elected chairperson of the GE Employees Share Fund in 1975.\n\n Quirini was accused of Communist Party affiliation during the McCarthy era because of her union advocacy. She received a subpoena and testified in a pre-hearing that she was not a proponent of Communism, but sought equal rights for all individuals. She testified that she had attended a Communist meeting, and even mentioned seeing \"company men\" from General Electric there. The case against her was dropped. Quirini filed a Freedom of Information Act request decades later to review the documents held by the FBI from the McCarthy era. Redacted copies of the completed request are available in Series 2.\n\n After her retirement from General Electric in 1980, Quirini became well known for her attempts to win greater benefits for GE retirees through advocacy, shareholder proposals and her annual speech at the GE shareholders meeting. Always wearing a bright T-shirt with the words \"GE Brings Good Things to Retirees, Please\" Quirini, along with other retirees and their supporters, frequently picketed at General Electric in Schenectady and at the annual shareholder meetings. She served as president of Local 301 Retirees Council and co-founded the GE Retirees Justice Fund. Her highly visible role at shareholder meetings brought her to the attention of Jack Welch, the chairman and CEO of General Electric from 1981-2001. Local playwright Gail George wrote a one-woman play about Quirini's relationship with Welch entitled <emph render=\"italic\">Helen and Jack.</emph>\n\n During her employment for GE, Quirini volunteered for non-union related causes. She joined the YWCA of Schenectady in 1943 and eventually became its president. Through her United Way work with Local 301, she began working with the Refreshing Springs Child Day Care alongside her friend Reverend Georgetta Dix in 1970, where her varied executive duties lasted until 1987.\n\n Quirini continued her activism during her retirement by volunteering for the rights and benefits of seniors and community causes in Schenectady County. She was a member or director of a wide variety of civic and labor organizations, including: the American Association of Retired Persons Chapter 490, Better Neighborhoods Inc., Citizens for Preservation and Revitalization, Human Services Planning Council's Aging Committee, IUE Local 301 Retirees Council, New York State Wide Senior Action Council, Schenectady Council of Senior Citizens, Schenectady County Committee on Health Care Issues, Schenectady County Council of Child Day Care Centers, and Schenectady County Human Rights Commission.\n\n Quirini also was the recipient of many awards. She received the United Way Joseph A. Beirne Award, the YWCA of Schenectady Jefferson Award and the General Electric Gerald L. Phillippe Award. She also received the Patroon award, the highest honor given by the City of Schenectady. Series 1 contains many more awards and related material.\n\n Selections from <archref linktype=\"simple\" href=\"http://www.albany.edu/history/histmedia/Hq.html\" actuate=\"onrequest\" show=\"new\"><emph render=\"italic\">Helen Quirini and General Electric: A Personal Memoir of World War II</emph></archref> are made available online through the University at Albany Department of History's History and Media Initiatives website and a copy of the full memoir is found in Series 1.\n\n Quirini also appeared in other publications about unions, women and community activists. Her work for GE retirees garnered her and the pension cause coverage in major newspapers and magazines across the country. In the 1990s, the Schenectady General Electric in the 20th Century Project extensively interviewed Quirini and different periods of her life are documented in articles and student research papers, many of which are available in the collection.",

              "content": "This collection documents the life, work and activism of Helen Quirini of Schenectady, New York. The collection represents Quirini's numerous activities and interests including her early work owning a local market with her brother, her 39 year employment for General Electric, her activism in unions during her employment and retirement, as well as her charitable activities where she pursued civil, housing, pension, women's and senior citizen's rights. \n\n The M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives received this collection through multiple donations. Helen Quirini donated material over approximately 10 years and her nephew Rudy Quirini donated the final materials following Helen Quirini's death in 2010. Many of the papers lacked original order and therefore archivists needed to impose order throughout the collection. Archivists created the series structure to represent Quirini's personal life, employment, labor union work and activism. She held many executive board positions after her retirement and remained an active volunteer and labor rights activist until her death. There is occasional overlap between topics and series such as senior citizens (Series 6, Subseries 5) and pension rights (found in General Electric Series 5). \n\n Quirini spent nearly her entire life in Schenectady, New York. This collection offers a perspective into industrial work during World War II and the life of a female union activist in the mid-20th Century through photographs, diary entries, labor union literature, grievance reports Quirini filed and labor union convention materials. The collection documents the workings of various local organizations through meeting minutes, budgets, correspondence, publications, by-laws, treasurer's reports and other internal documents. Quirini also worked for local chapters of larger organizations. Quirini was active in her local community and corresponded with State and National legislators about a variety of topics, including day care services, labor unions, local government, Schenectady County development, senior citizens' issues and more. \n\n Quirini maintained extensive subject files with clippings, articles, photographs and reports. Also available are collections of publications and newsletters from relevant organizations, such as UE and IUE publications and the New York State Wide Senior Action Council's newsletter. \n\n The audiovisual portion of this collection includes audio and video cassettes, DVDs, CDs, reel-to-reel tapes, 8mm film and 45 RPM record singles.\n\n Please note that not all dates are inclusive.\n\n Related collections in the Department of Special Collections and Archives include the records of IUE-CWA Local 301 (APAP-023), Ralph Boyd Papers (APAP-165, Helen Quirini's friend and fellow advocate for the rights of GE Retirees), Associated Industries of New York State, Inc. (APAP-043) , and the New York State Wide Senior Action Council (APAP-111). Issues of the newspapers of Local 301 are available in microfilm, paper, and electronic format in the records of IUE-CWA Local 301 (APAP-023) including special Local 301 publications from the 1966 and 1969 strikes.\n\n Quirini deposited various materials at other repositories including the: Schenectady Public Library (material related to Georgetta Dix) and the NYU Tamiment Libraries and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives. Her nephew Rudolph Quirini also donated materials to the Grems-Doolittle Library at the Schenectady County Historical Society.\n\n Reproductions of items from this collection are available in the exhibit <archref linktype=\"simple\" href=\"http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/documentinglabor/\" actuate=\"onrequest\" show=\"new\">Documenting Labor Inside and Out: Labor History in New York State's Capital District</archref>.",

              "content": "\"Let the people know, make the people care and help the people act\" was the motto adopted by the 38 women who founded the League of Women Voters of Rensselaer County (LWVRC) in October 1939. The first president of the LWVRC was Beulah Bailey Thull (1891-1975), who was one of Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt's speechwriters at the time. In addition to helping establish the Rensselaer County League, Thull helped establish the Women's Legislative Forum and the Civil Service Employees Association (CSEA) (serving as the latter's first president). Thull did not finish out her term with the LWVRC and was replaced by Catherine Benson. Though she was not originally from New York, Benson became an important leader in the early years of the LWVRC and in the New York State suffrage movement. World War I interrupted Benson's plans to become a doctor and instead she enrolled in Bellevue Hospital's nurses training course in New York City. By the time she became a nurse, the war ended. She married a doctor who set up a practice in Troy, NY. During the 1940s and 1950s, Benson became the Director of Nurses at Leonard Hospital in Troy.\n\n A month after its founding, the LWVRC drafted a letter to Mr. Raymond T. Neitzel, President of Troy's Chamber of Commerce, stating that \"the League has but one purpose - 'Better Government.'\" At the time of the LWVRC's founding, the Troy Chamber of Commerce called for a survey of Troy's budget. The LWVRC saw an opportunity for political involvement at the local level and took it. The letter to Neitzel resulted in a luncheon hosted by the LWVRC, whereby the Mayor of Troy \"appointed a citizens committee to sit in with him on the preparation of the budget.\" There were 30 people on the committee including the LWVRC's president. The LWVRC produced a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of Troy's budget and of the comparative cost of government in Troy, along with a chart showing the necessary factors of a good budget. \"This is the first time that such a thing had ever happened in Troy as the budget was usually a secret chamber act.\" Thus began the LWVRC's non-partisan involvement in local government. \n\n By 1944, the LWVRC began plans to expand both its membership and scope of activities. It did this by establishing a headquarters and developing committees, including finance, public relations, programming, research, government, foreign relations, and training. In the same year, the LWVRC formed a coalition with the Business and Professional Women's Club, the YWCA, and the Junior League, creating the Women's Joint Education Committee. \"Its purpose was to secure an enlarged Board of Education in Troy with one or more women members, with the hope of improving the school system.\" The committee quickly learned the ins and outs of the politics of education, suggesting areas for change and/or expansion. As a result, the LWVRC found a niche in public education. In December of 1955, <emph render=\"italic\">Trojans, Know Your Schools</emph>, was published. It \"presented concise, non-partisan information concerning the public schools of the Troy District.\" As a result of the publication, board of education meetings were opened to the public. <emph render=\"italic\">Know Your Schools</emph> involved a survey of the school boards, finances, and teachers. The first decade of the LWVRC was marked a success. The chapter began the <emph render=\"italic\">Know Your County</emph> series and had a regular monthly radio program on WTRY. \n\n The LWVRC's activities expanded in the 1950s. <emph render=\"italic\">Know Your Town</emph> became one of the main local projects, surveying county departments and chronicling the county's history for its citizens. The state League published a similar booklet for New York State, entitled <emph render=\"italic\">Know Your State</emph>. <emph render=\"italic\">Know Your Town</emph> was published in 1950 and gained a great deal of accolades (see clippings in Series 1, Box 1, Folder 18). 1950 was also the first year the LWVRC published election guides, which provided information to citizens about candidates and amendments that were up for a vote in upcoming government and school elections. The LWVRC then expanded its scope by speaking out about national and international issues. In 1953, the LWVRC participated in United Nations Day and in 1954 it came out against the Bricker Amendment, which would \"define and limit the President's treaty-making powers.\" The LWVRC believed that such an amendment was \"an impediment to the proper conduct of foreign affairs, a disguised isolationist effort to reverse and prevent cooperation in international issues, a violation of the expressed convictions of the framers of the Constitution, and an expression of distrust of both the President and the Senate.\" On state matters, the LWVRC pressed New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey to pass legislation for permanent personal registration, which, to the organization's dismay, Dewey vetoed in 1955. The latter part of the 1950s saw the League involved in conservation, court reform, county probation, world trade, charter reform, municipal government, equal pay for equal work, improvement of the primary and electoral systems, regulation of child labor laws, urban renewal and the implications of Sputnik. This did not replace past agenda items like the Troy school budget or permanent personal registration. The LWVRC merely continued to expand its scope on various levels. \n\n The prosopography of the LWVRC at the end of the decade was typical of many women's groups in the country. The median age of the members was 45, 43 for the presidents. 50% of the members were college graduates. 82% of the members were married, with a median family income of $10,000. Only 6% of the membership had incomes below $5000.\n\n In the 1960s, the LWVRC continued to publish its Bulletin, Facts for Voters, and Voters Guides. Also civil rights began to affect the LWVRC's activities in the second half of the decade. However, the documents do not suggest any major activity within the Civil Rights Movement or Women's Rights Movement per se. According to the LWVRC's <emph render=\"italic\">1964 Annual Report</emph>, the League of Women Voters of Rensselaer County members participated in an NAACP survey (survey of what is unclear). In addition, two members served on different committees of the Troy Area Committee for Human Rights in order to prepare voters service materials about local elections for inner-city voters. LWVRC members also conducted a follow-up study of sub-standard rural and urban housing with a slide show that was shown to the community.\n\n In 1965, the LWVRC ran the \"Voters Mailbag\" column of the <emph render=\"italic\">Troy Record</emph>. That same year, the local LWVRC took on a national item project - development of human resources - in order to parallel the national League's agenda. Development of Human Resources explored the problems of the poor, automation, employment and education. Out of this project, the LWVRC published <emph render=\"italic\">Up the Ladder</emph> (see Series 2) and <emph render=\"italic\">Day Care: Community Challenge and Responsibility</emph> (see Series 2). <emph render=\"italic\">Up the Ladder</emph> was partially subsidized by the United Way and thus distributed to their participating social agencies. <emph render=\"italic\">Day Care: Community Challenge and Responsibility</emph> was the result of a Community Day Care Conference, which featured panel discussions by day care providers, educators and public officials. As a result, the County Day Care Council was established and <emph render=\"italic\">Day Care</emph>, a citizens' guide for setting up day care centers, was published.\n\n In the early 1970s, the LWVRC was diligently fundraising, working on the county and city charters, land use and health care and perfecting their regular agenda items such as voter registration and school initiatives. Its members were very supportive of school lunch programs in Troy city schools. They also added the <emph render=\"italic\">Know Your Schools</emph> column of the <emph render=\"italic\">Times Record</emph>. They continued their concern on national and international levels. For example, the LWVRC supported \"a fair and thorough impeachment inquiry of President Nixon by the House Judiciary Committee.\" In addition, members supported the Equal Rights Amendment, which was eventually defeated. The LWVRC was also beginning to deal with the issue of allowing men into the organization as full voting members. The issue was contentious on a national level, but the Rensselaer County chapter appeared to be more flexible about the issue.\n\n By 1979, the League of Women Voters of Rensselaer County celebrated its 40th anniversary. It encouraged informed voter participation via publications like \"Facts for Voters,\" \"Newcomers Flyers,\" and \"Civic Information Sheets.\" The LWVRC organized Meet the Candidates forums and high school voter registration drives. In a period of 40 years, the LWVRC lobbied the state legislature for improved election laws and sponsored monthly luncheon lectures on issues such as property tax assessment, urban crisis, women and the law and the family court system. Finally, it was consistently active in evaluations of county and city charters in Rensselaer County.\n\n In the 1980s, the LWVRC moved into newer, sometimes more controversial issues. Reapportionment of the county legislature, women and the law, and reproductive rights were some of the newer concerns the LWVRC tackled. The LWVRC also became an integral supporter of the \"Bottle Bill\" of the early 1980s. In 1983, the organization agreed to store its papers and publications at the Troy Public Library. It received a $4200 grant from the Howard and Bush Foundation in order to prepare \"an historical repository of LWVRC papers at the Troy Public Library.\" At the same time, the LWVRC helped form the Inter-League Organization (ILO) in order to create a coalition of the five local Leagues in the Capital region.\n\n The more recent records are not as complete. However the LWVRC has not wavered in its traditional goals of nonpartisan, educational information for citizens of the Capital region. In 1992, <emph render=\"italic\">A Citizens' Guide to Governments in Rensselaer County</emph> was published under the auspices of the Tema Bellinson Memorial Fund. The publication described the governmental functions for each of the 21 municipal governments of the county (see Series 2). The LWVRC's involvement in welfare issues focused on the needs of children via the Healthy Kids Program with Samaritan Hospital (1994), Bureau of Youth Services and Human Services contracts (1995). Children at risk became a National Junior League focus item in the late 1990s. Members also grew concerned about criminal justice reform and lobbying reform.\n\n The League of Women Voters of Rensselaer County continued to fall in line with the national League by adopting another item agenda the mid 1990s - \"Making Democracy Work\" (see Series 6, Box 1, Folder 33 and Box 2, Folders 4, 6, and 8). Activities have concentrated on outreach and involvement of the under-served communities in the county, distributing voter education materials, and election information to state agencies such as WIC, day cares, youth programs, food pantries, public housing authorities, and private agencies like the YWCA, TRIP, and Unity House. Two multi-session community meetings of LWVRC members and representatives from these groups have been held to discuss ways to increase voter participation.",

              "content": "The Knolls Action Project based in Albany, New York grew out of the Blue Karner Affinity Group that was formed by local activists to participate in anti-nuclear protests at the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in New Hampshire in 1978. The group decided to focus on the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory (KAPL), a General Electric facility that conducted research and training on nuclear propulsion systems for the United States Navy. The KAPL site, located in Niskayuna, N.Y., designed propulsion systems for the nuclear navy, including the Trident submarine system. The West Milton, N.Y. KAPL facility (or Kesselring site) was where naval crews trained to operate the Trident and other nuclear submarines [KAP fundraising letter, 1983, Series 1, Box 2, Folder 4]. In October 1978 the group began its Friday morning leafleting of KAPL workers at the facility's two sites. The purpose was to educate workers to the issues related to KAPL and the arms race. Each leaflet began with a message to KAPL employees, and included a reprint of articles, news clippings, and reports that often contradicted information that was disseminated in the mainstream media. Leaflet topics included disarmament, radiation safety, economic conversion, US-Soviet relations and nonviolence. In December 1978, the Knolls Community Action Conversion Project was formed with \"goals of public education related to the work of KAPL, economic conversion and nonviolent resistance\" [Leaflet dated Nov.18, 1988, Series 1, Box 2, Folder 4]. Informal conversations with workers led to the knowledge of problems regarding worker and environmental safety. In October 1979 the Knolls Action Coalition was officially formed and in 1981 the name Knolls Action Project (KAP) was adopted. By the summer of 1981, KAP was distributing 450-500 leaflets weekly to KAPL employees as they drove to work. According to a KAP newsletter, one of the objectives of the leafleting was \"to create a dialogue and speak to people's conscience. We have made a great effort not to be 'pointing the finger' at the individuals who work at Knolls. In fact the strength of our presence is in the way we actively respect Knolls workers as people, greet them with openness, keep our sense of humor and choose not to respond to the occasional expressions of anger or violence with the same. The strength of our message is that we incorporate the necessity of economic conversion and job security as we work for an end to the destructive work that Knolls is involved with\" [Newsletter dated Summer 1981, Series 1, Box 3, Folder 7].\n\n In addition to its educational efforts, KAP actively worked to effect changes. It put military personnel in touch with draft counseling organizations, and developed a program to support KAPL workers who decided to seek alternative employment. The group faced its first direct challenge when, in July 1982, it was banned by KAPL management from entering the grounds of the Niskayuna facility. Leafleting continued across the road. The New York Civil Liberties Union took the case to Federal Court claiming KAPL violated the group's Constitutional rights and right of free speech. The Judge ruled in favor of KAPL in January 1985 explaining it was a classified facility with a right to limit public access. The U.S Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision. In 1986 KAP organized opposition to the naming of a nuclear submarine after the city of Albany. KAP also organized a caravan to follow the rail route of the Seawolf nuclear reactor containment vessel that was dug up and transported from West Milton to Ballston Spa where it was shipped by rail to a nuclear waste dump [Newsletter dated Fall 1988, Series 1, Box 3, Folder 7].\n\n Other KAP activities involved public education, including house meetings, personal contact with groups and individuals, and door-to-door canvassing. Beginning in 1979 KAP organized annual vigils to commemorate the anniversaries of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Though nonviolent and generally non-confrontational, they practiced civil disobedience on several occasions. The first time, in January 1981, twelve members of the group were arrested. KAP's interest in disarmament led some of its members to become involved in other activist groups as well. Billy Aul became a local draft counselor and joined Upstate Resistance. KAP members were also involved in military tax resistance.\n\n The early 1990s saw KAP increase involvement in regional and national activities, including \"campaigns for legislation affecting the nuclear weapons complex, participation in regulatory and oversite hearings, and national networking and support for the work of other groups allied against the Department of Energy's military nuclear complex. . involvement in additional peace, environmental, and public policy issues relating to Knolls and the weapons complex\" [Meeting Minutes, March 2, 1993, Series 1, Box 3, Folder 4]. With the apparent end of the Cold War, environmental issues began to take on importance. One larger project was the Nuclear Waste Track Watch Project (NWTW). KAP worked with the Snake River Alliance and Nukewatch to track KAPL radioactive waste as it was shipped to a DOE site in Idaho. The project was intended to yield national coverage of \"secret\" KAPL/Navy waste shipments [Meeting Minutes, July 22, 1992, Series 1, Box 3, Folder 6].\n\n By 1993 KAP was able to claim numerous successes. It had obtained national grants and recognition, maintained a committed core group and its philosophical cohesion, was active in several coalitions, and was able to claim successes in its work against nuclear navy programs. On the other hand, there was concern about the reduction in donations, the over-reliance on grants and the lack of enthusiasm for fundraising. There was apprehension regarding the declining energy in the core group and interest in the broader community. There was concern about the perception that the Cold War was over and that the work at KAPL was no longer an issue [1993 Annual Meeting Minutes, November 21, 1993, Series 1, Box 3, Folder 5].\n\n In 1994, amid rising tensions and disagreement over the direction of the group, KAP members decided to discontinue leafleting and to end formal meetings.\n\n KAP was involved with a network of local and national groups including the Military Production Network (MPN), Mobilization for Survival, the regional Weapons Facilities Conversion Network, Upstate Nuclear Weapons Facility Networking Project, the Coalition to Stop Trident, the Economic Conversion Study Group, and the Coalition for a Clean Mohawk River. Publications from these and other organizations can be found in this collection.\n\n KAP was staffed mostly by volunteers and financed through donations and fundraisers. It's members came from the religious, women's, and peace communities. Due to the informal nature of the group, KAP did not have any prominent leaders. At any given time there was a core group of approximately 8-10 volunteers. There was usually one part-time, paid, staff person. Foundation grants totaling $15,500 in 1993 allowed KAP to increase the hours of the staff person. As an organization it was instrumental in forming the Social Action Center in Albany, which later became known as the Social Justice Center.",

              "content": "These records document the activities and interests of KAP from 1978 to 1994. Some of the information pre-dates the founding of the organization, but was obtained by members of KAP for research or informational purposes. The collection is comprehensive, and contains meeting minutes, newsletters, leaflets, clippings, reports, books and publications, audiovisuals, and peace-related memorabilia. Though abundant, some of the information is redundant and some of the same clippings, leaflets and reports can be found filed in several different locations.\n\n Materials from 1979 and the early 1980s come from John Ragusa and/or Mike Baum. Notebooks and folders contained meeting notes, flyers, clippings, slide show presentation notes, and photographs of the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory.\n\n The records consist primarily of information relating to subject matter of relevance to KAP. The collection is divided into nine series, four of which contain subject files. Important topics have been filed within their own series. Series 6 contains miscellaneous subject files. Historical information for the group can be found in newsletters, meeting minutes, annual reviews, and fact sheets filed in Series 1. The meeting minutes provide insight into the organization and operations of KAP between 1982 and 1993. There are no minutes from meetings prior to July, 1982. The most recent minutes are from the annual meeting of November 21 and 30, 1993, and includes an income/expense statement and notes on the discussions regarding the strengths and weaknesses of KAP. Some of this information is summarized in the Spring 1994 newsletter, and illustrates the difficulties and issues the organization faced after 15 years. Series 2 contains information on other activist groups involved in the anti-nuclear movement. Series 8 contains copies of legal documents and transcripts. Series 9 is a small collection of audiovisual materials. The files are arranged in alphabetical order within each series.\n\n The collection contains many copies of leaflets distributed at KAPL between 1979 and 1994. Most can be found in Series 1, but many have been filed within their subject files. In addition to leafleting KAPL, members of the group were involved in issues such as radioactive contamination, radioactive waste transport, draft resistance and nuclear disarmament. KAP formed alliances with many national and regional organizations. Its work with the Snake River Alliance and Nukewatch on the Nuclear Waste Track Watch (1992-1993) is well documented. The collection is a good source of information on the national anti-nuclear movement as well as local. There are newsletters and flyers prepared by the Center for Economic Conversion, Economists Allied for Arms Reduction, Native Americans for a Clean Environment and many others (see Series 2 and Series 7).\n\n KAP conducted extensive research on nuclear issues, and collected and saved publications and newsletters from numerous sources. Many of these were adapted for use as leaflet topics. Series 5 contains official government reports from such agencies as the Government Accounting Office, the U.S. Department of Energy and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. It also contains books and other publications by such organizations as Worldwatch Institute, Institute for Policy Studies, American Friends Service Committee, and The Boston Study Group. Oversize boxes contain newsletters and publications from national and international organizations such as Greenpeace, Physicians for Social Responsibility, the Government Accountability Project, and many grassroots organizations.\n\n The collection contains an abundance of information on draft resistance. Billy Aul, a member of KAP, was a local draft counselor. During the 1980s through the Gulf War in 1991, KAP provided assistance to conscientious objectors, appeared at high schools and street fairs to counteract military recruitment efforts, and worked in the capital region for the conversion of military resources to civilian use. Series 7 contains five boxes with information relating to these efforts.\n\n There are several items of ephemera in series 9.\n\n <emph render=\"bold\">Glossary</emph>.\n\n This glossary identifies some of the more frequently used acronyms in this finding aid and in the materials in the KAP collection.\n\n AFR - Advanced Fleet Reactor.\n\n CABEC - Capital Area and Berkshire County Economic Conversion study group.\n\n CARD - Committee Against Registration and the Draft.\n\n CCCO - Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors.\n\n CERCLA - Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.\n\n DEC - Department of Environmental Conservation.\n\n DOD - Department of Defense.\n\n DOE - Department of Energy.\n\n ECAAR - Economists Allied for Arms Reduction.\n\n ELF - Extremely Low Frequency.\n\n EPA - Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n ERWM - Environmental Restoration and Waste Management.\n\n FOIA - Freedom of Information Act.\n\n GAO - Government Accounting Office.\n\n HEAL - Hanford Education Action League.\n\n IEER - Institute for Energy and Environmental Research.\n\n INEL - Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.\n\n KAP - Knolls Action Project.\n\n KAPL - Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory.\n\n LLRW - Low Level Radioactive Waste.\n\n MPN - Military Production Network.\n\n MTRAF - Military Tax Resistance and Alternative Fund.\n\n NARMIC - National Action Research on the Military Industrial Complex.\n\n NIRS - Nuclear Information and Resource Service.\n\n NISBCO - National Interreligious Service Board for Conscientious Objectors.\n\n NLG - National Lawyers Guild.\n\n NNP - Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program.\n\n NRDC - National Resources Defense Council.\n\n NRF - Naval Reactors Facility.\n\n NRP - Naval Reactor Program.\n\n NWFNP - Nuclear Weapons Facility Networking Project.\n\n NWTW - Nuclear Waste Train Watch.\n\n ONR - Office of Naval Research.\n\n PEIS - Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement.\n\n PSR - Physicians for Social Responsibility.\n\n RCRA - Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (EPA).\n\n SNF - Spent Nuclear Fuel.\n\n SNR - Schenectady Naval Reactors.\n\n SPRU - Separations Processing Research Unit.\n\n SRA - Snake River Alliance.\n\n SRS - Savannah River Site.\n\n SSN - nuclear attack submarines.\n\n SSN-21 - Seawolf Submarine.\n\n TMI - Three Mile Island.",

ACT UP's non-violent direct action, often using vocal demonstrations and dramatic acts of civil disobedience, focuses attention on the crucial issues of the AIDS crisis.\n\n On June 17, 1989, the Albany Chapter of ACT UP called for the city to distribute clean needles to drug users and reintroduce and pass a homosexual rights ordinance. In addition, ACT UP, a group whose purpose is to educate American youth about AIDS prevention, opened its first college chapter at the University at Albany, SUNY in 1990. The Albany Chapter was affiliated with the New York City ACT UP Chapter. A main goal of the group was to educate students and young people about AIDS.",

The collection consists of administrative files such as handbooks for activists, activism in various chapters, the AIDS Curriculum Lesson for the City of Albany, AIDS education and preventive guides and programs, correspondence, minutes, and papers of the Health Systems Agency of Northeastern New York, Inc., from 1990 to 1991. It also includes several legal documents related to human rights, penal law, and public health law, and meeting notes.\n\n Also included in the collection is a videotape, programs and fliers from Albany and other chapters, workshop programs, a boycott fact package, activism related to prisons and AIDS, board of education policies of Massachusetts, New York, and San Francisco. In addition, the collection includes materials from HIV regional forum, numerous news clippings and news releases, draft plan for HIV/AIDS services, and public comments on AIDS. The collection also includes publications about budget funding for AIDS in New York State, reports and research papers, journals, and newsletters published by other organizations.\n\n The strengths of this collection are the posters, fliers, and other activism material from ACT UP chapters. In addition, most of the materials in this collection are in good condition. The collection's lack of administrative records for the Albany chapter is a weakness.\n\n The inactive records of ACT UP/NY were deposited in the New York Public Library in 1996 and the Lesbian Herstory Archives in Brooklyn also hold materials related to ACT UP activities in New York.",

              "content": "John J. Mather was a public servant who held a number of positions with the State University of New York (SUNY) Central Administration. Born in 1922 in Rolfe, Iowa, Mather served in the Navy during World War II. He worked for twelve years as a high school social studies teacher and later served as secretary to the African American Institute in New York City before joining the staff of the SUNY system during the mid-1960s. Mather began his career at SUNY as one of several assistants to the Chancellor. During the late 1960s, he was involved in efforts to document and understand student unrest on the various SUNY campuses. In 1971, Mather was promoted to the position of Executive Assistant to the Chancellor. In this position he participated in the establishment of the Empire State Youth Theatre Institute, helped organized a student exchange program with Russia, oversaw a major study of the economic impact of the SUNY system, and served as the Chancellor\u2019s representative during the conversion of the Delaware &amp; Hudson Building in downtown Albany into a headquarters for SUNY Central. In 1978, Mather became Associate Chancellor for Continuing Education and Public Service, a position he would hold until 1984. During this time he oversaw the establishment and expansion of the New York Network, SUNY\u2019s public television production studio.\n\n In 1984, Mather became the Administrator of the SUNY System Business Development Services Office. Here he was responsible for creating and overseeing several programs in which the various SUNY campuses collaborated with the private sector to encourage the economic development of New York State. The Small Business Development Center (SBDC) assisted small business owners, while the SUNY Business and Industry Centers (initially referred to as Development Centers for Business) provided research, training and technical support to businesses of all sizes, including national and multinational businesses looking to expand their operations in New York State. The Export New York program, meanwhile, encouraged New York State businesses to export to countries outside the United States.\n\n After retiring from the SUNY system in 1990, Mather became the president of Rolfe, Inc., a private consulting company which worked on establishing trade links between America and Europe. During this period Mather helped establish a sister cities program which facilitated cultural and business exchanges between Albany and Tula, Russia and Ghent, Belgium. In the mid-1990s Mather was also active in a campaign to prevent Governor Pataki from cutting the SUNY budget. He died in 2000.",

The collection contains Mather\u2019s vast correspondence with colleagues and constituents as Assistant to the SUNY Chancellor (1965-1971), Executive Assistant to the Chancellor (1971-1978) and Associate Chancellor for Public Service (1978-1984).\n\n The collection is divided into four series. Series 1: Correspondence (1966-1990) contains blue carbon copies of Mather\u2019s correspondence from throughout his career. This includes routine administrative correspondence as well as letters and memoranda to other SUNY administrators and to the Chancellor. It includes complete correspondence files for the years 1967, 1970 through 1972, 1977 through 1978 and 1981 through 1984 as well as partial correspondence files for the years 1966, 1968 and 1990.\n\n Series 2: SUNY Administrative (1965-1996) contains materials related to the general administration of the State University of New York (SUNY), largely but not exclusively dating from John Mather\u2019s service as Assistant to the Chancellor (1965-1971), Executive Assistant to the Chancellor (1971-1978) and Associate Chancellor for Public Service (1978-1984). Series 2 is divided into 4 subseries. Subseries 1: Campus Unrest (1967-1973) contains files related to student unrest on the various SUNY campuses during the late 1960s and early 1970s. This subseries is arranged alphabetically by name of campus and/or by subject matter. Nearly all of the SUNY campuses experienced some form of student unrest during this period, and several, most notably SUNY Stony Brook, experienced large-scale disruption due to riots and protests. Subseries 2: New York Network (1975-1991) contains records related to New York Network, the public-access television studio run by the State University system. Subseries 3: Subject File (1969-1996) contains subject files related to a wide variety of topics, most notably the Empire State Youth Theatre Institute and the Russian exchange student program. It is organized alphabetically by subject. Subseries 4: SUNY Publications (1965-1995) contains publications of the State University of New York central administration, including annual reports, periodicals and related documents. Many different publication series are represented in this subseries, although none of them are complete.\n\n Series 3: SUNY System Business Development Services (1981-1995) contains material related to Mather\u2019s service as administrator of this department and the various programs which he oversaw there. It is divided into four subseries, including a general subject file and subseries on the three main programs of the Business Development Services Office: the Small Business Development Center, the Business and Industry Centers, and Export New York.\n\n Series 4: Rolfe, Inc. (1989-1996) contains material related to the private consulting firm which Mather ran following his retirement from the SUNY system.",

The death penalty is documented in the U.S. as well as internationally including Europe, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Mexico, Vietnam, and China.\n\n The major part of this collection is composed of news clippings, from 1982 to 2000. Rick Halperin collected news clippings on death penalty topics from diverse national and local newspapers, magazines, and websites, including media in other countries. The content of this news clipping collection is not limited to news reports on specific death sentence cases, but includes various statistical data and general opinions about the death penalty, debates and controversies on execution methods, news reports on rallies pertaining to capital punishment, and human rights issues of prisoners. In addition, interviews with prisoners scheduled to be executed and photographs of victims, criminals, execution facilities, and capital punishment abolitionists are included in this collection.\n\n Another interesting part of this collection is materials from Amnesty International USA (AI USA). As one of the leading organizations to work towards the abolition of the death penalty, this organization has produced and disseminated diverse materials, including mailings, magazines, handbook for AI USA trainers, and research papers on death penalty related topics. For instance, Amnesty International USA's Urgent Action is a letter of notification seeking demonstrative action to abolish execution. This letter provides background information on an upcoming execution case and recommended activities against the execution.\n\n The collection lacks information on Halperin's personal activities as a professor at Southern Methodist University and research papers written by him that would show his opinions on the death penalty. Also, absent are documents that would illuminate Halperin's personal life.

              "content": "The Affordable Housing Partnership (AHP) was founded in 1986 after a series of protests staged by the United Tenants of Albany (UTA) as a reaction to the prejudicial methods of awarding loans practiced by several banks in the Capital District. This organization was originally called the Albany County Public-Private Partnership but its name was changed in 1989. The AHP is a non-profit forum designed to address the growing housing problem in the Capital District. As the UTA bank protests that culminated in 1995 attest (see administrative history of the UTA) many banks and loan companies in Albany County were severely discriminating against low-to-moderate- income families and business owners when awarding loans. Since governmental programs for assisting this population with buying homes and supporting businesses were extremely scarce during the 1980s, the Affordable Housing Partnership was created as a three-front approach to solving this problem. Members of the banking, public sector and local housing related community organizations were brought together to attempt to create programs to aid low to moderate-income clients.\n\n At first this organization was merely informational in nature and participating banks were not asked to donate funds to provide clients with low interest loans. In 1989, after realizing that the sources for reasonably priced loans were extremely limited, the founders of the AHP took the final step and became a mortgage and loan company. The AHP accepts and reviews loan applications that are in turn funded by another institution, the Capital Affordable Housing Funding Corporation (CAHFC). One representative from each of the four banks currently participating in the AHP form the CAHFC. To maintain a vote in the CAHFC, the banks must contribute a certain investment; otherwise the representative is present at meetings only in an advisory position. While the value may change over time, the number of \"financial units\" an organization contributes determines the number of votes that institution has and therefore how influential the institution is in determining which loans are authorized. These funds are placed into a community loan pool for permanent mortgage and construction mortgage loan funds. Together, the AHP and CAHFC determine if a client fits their criterion for a reasonable risk.[1]\n\n The mission statement of the AHP states that the organization will provide a frank forum for the exchange of information concerning the need for affordable housing in Albany County and the obstacles faced in efforts to meet those needs. Through this free exchange the AHP aims to promote programs that will aid in developing housing for low to moderate-income families, assess the efficiency of those that already exist and attempt to solve problems that stand in the way of creating such programs. They hope to achieve this through cooperating with other organizations devoted to helping low-to-moderate income families find housing and by providing a forum for local banks and housing organizations to discuss housing problems.[2]\n\n The AHP is comprised of twelve members, four members from each of the banking, community and public sectors. A coordination team is in charge of ensuring that the agendas and meetings of the AHP are properly planned and that the recommendations of the partnership are acted upon. The meetings are presided over by the board chair. In the event of his or her absence, the vice chair, the president, the executive vice president, and the vice president serve in descending order of importance. If none of these people are available, the partnership can elect a president to preside. The Policy Committee of the AHP is responsible for reviewing loan applications and then presenting them to the board for final approval. The Capital Affordable Housing Funding Corporation then finances the loan.\n\n While one of the major functions of the AHP is to act as a source for reasonably priced loans, the AHP also attempts to help their clients by creating programs designed to make the experience of buying a home easier. One such program is the Albany Home Store. This program, founded in 1997, attempts to simplify the complicated process of buying a home by providing a \"one-stop\" resource for advice and funding for first-time homebuyers. This program offers the buyer pre-purchase counseling, information on available homes and information on financing. The Home Store, with the aid of the AHP, puts clients in contact with banks and realtors thus facilitating the experience. Members of the AHP act as the coordinators for the Home Store by maintaining lists of available real estate, sponsoring homebuyer workshops, and participating in home buyer programs sponsored by banks, non-profit organizations, realtors and other such organizations in order to keep abreast of available housing programs.[3]",

Given the topical nature of this record group, its individual files are separated into four major series: Administration, Meetings and Resolutions, Financial Information, and Subject Files. It includes the AHP and CAHFC's correspondence, meeting minutes and agendas, news clippings, press releases and newsletters, reports and testimonies.\n\n The bulk of this record group is comprised of a group of subject files covering the major concerns of the AHP and the CAHFC. Most of these files concern the UTA bank protests that cover the years from 1984-1995. These documents discuss the prejudicial loan practices of Chase/Chemical Bank, Fleet Bank, Key Bank and NORSTAR Bank and the UTA's attempts to amend the Community Reinvestment Act responsible for regulating the loan practices of banks. This is seen as an important achievement for the cause of affordable housing. The Subject Files series is made up of an alphabetical list of topics important to the AHP.\n\n In addition to the subject files series covering the specific activities of the AHP, this record group also includes documents that record the administration and financial aspects of the AHP and CAHFC. This record group contains all of the AHP's and CAHFC's minutes and agendas from 1986-2001, financial reports from 1990-2001, annual reports and goal statements from 1987-1998 and drafts of their mission statement and by-laws.\n\n Finally, this record group includes a restricted Loan Application series. Series 5 holds actual loan applications and the AHP's resolutions on these applications, which contain sensitive information.",

Davis earned a BA in Science Education in 1964 and an M.L.S. in 1970 from the State University of New York at Albany, as the University at Albany, SUNY was then known. After graduating, Jackson Davis worked as a bibliographer at such organizations as the National Science Foundation Institute for Science Teachers and the State University of New York at Albany Atmospheric Sciences Research Center. In September 1971 he became an administrator at the Albany County Environmental Advisory Council, which had recently joined with the councils of three other counties to form the Four County Recycling Committee. Davis' work there was research on such topics as solid waste recycling and the creation and protection of open space areas including the Albany Pine Bush. Additional Information about Davis' employment history is available in Series 8. \n\n During the early 1970s, Jackson Davis participated in the Environmental Forum program at the State University of New York at Albany. This was a public forum that brought local speakers on environmental topics to campus for lectures and a class in the Environmental Studies program. The program began in 1970 and lasted until it was eliminated by budget cuts in 1977.\n\n Jackson Davis has also been involved in the Town of Nassau Conservation Advisory Council. Formed in 1972, this council was responsible for preparing reports and providing advice for the town council. Davis was chair of the advisory council during a controversial proposal to build the Brainard Quarry at Snake Mountain during the mid-1990s. Other organizations represented in the collection include the Futures Group of Glastonbury, Connecticut, for which Davis was a research assistant from 1975-1977, and the New York State Coalition for Local Self Reliance, which promoted sustainable local methods of food production. Other groups that Jackson Davis has worked with, but are not represented in the collection, include the Capital District Regional Planning Commission, the US Coast Guard's Hazardous Waste Amelioration Project, and the Nature Conservancy.",

The collection consists of publications, minutes, notes, news clippings, and memoranda from local and regional environmental groups Davis has worked with, as well as a collection of subject files created by Davis relating to a wide variety of environmental topics. Also included are a collection of Davis' bibliographical projects and a number of environmental health publications collected by Davis' father, Dr. H. Jackson Davis, Sr. Dr. Davis served as health commissioner in Rensselaer County and is represented in this collection by some of his collected publications. \n\n Jackson Davis worked for a number of organizations doing bibliographical research. Much of the material in the collection was created through the collection of sources and compiling of bibliographies. Part of Davis' research process was the listing of subject headings, in general or in Library of Congress format. The Bibliography series contains research on certain environmental topics that have no direct relation to the organizations that Davis worked for. Research materials produced for a specific organization are retained in the appropriate series. There is little biographical information in this collection; instead it's strength is the papers produced and collected by Jackson Davis and the various environmental organizations. \n\n Several collections in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives provide further information on the environmental issues that were of concern to Davis. For a complete list of related collections, see the Conservation and the Environment subject guide. Of particular note are the papers of Robert Reinow (UA-902.009) and Lou Ismay, both of whom were involved in the Environmental Forum while teaching at the State University of New York at Albany.",

              "content": "Nancy Papish, a resident of Schenectady, New York, became involved with environmental activism at a local and regional level in the 1970s. Papish's papers document her involvement with Clearwater, North River Friends of Clearwater (NRFC), and the campaign to stop Hydro-Quebec's development plan for James Bay in northern Quebec.\n\n Clearwater refers to both a boat and an environmental organization of more than 10,000 members. Clearwater's history dates to the late 1960s when folk singer and activist Pete Seeger became interested in building a recreation of the sloops that traveled the Hudson River in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The Hudson River Sloop Restoration (HRSR) was the precursor organization, which eventually became Hudson River Sloop Clearwater (HRSC). Its original goal was simply to build the sloop that Seeger envisioned. However, most HRSR members also shared an interest in cleaning up the polluted Hudson River. They decided to use the boat as a \"floating classroom\", raising public awareness about the need to protect the Hudson by conducting educational sails on the river.\n\n The Hudson River Sloop Clearwater launched in 1969. Today, more than 12,000 people sail on the Clearwater each year. The crew is comprised of paid staff and Clearwater member volunteers. The organization's efforts expanded over the years to include advocating for green space along the river's banks as well as upkeep of the river itself. Clearwater is also well-known for its annual Great Hudson River Revival, a festival of music, arts, and environmental education. [Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc. (undated) \"About Clearwater\". Accessed 27 January 2005, http://www.clearwater.org/about.html].\n\n Founded in 1976, the North River Friends of Clearwater is a sloop club based in the Capital District. Sloop clubs are local organizations that support Clearwater's mission through activities like fundraising and public relations. NRFC, which has an office in downtown Albany, holds monthly meetings regarding sloop issues and works with other local environmental organizations such as the Sierra Club, Save the Pinebush, and the Adirondack Mountain Club on issues of mutual concern. [Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc. (undated) \"Clearwater Sloop Clubs\". Accessed 27 January 2005, http://www.clearwater.org/clubs.html].\n\n Nancy Papish served on numerous committees for the NRFC and played a significant role in coordinating efforts between the Capital Region sloop club and the HRSC parent organization. As an early member of the group, she narrated a slide show that educated the public about Clearwater's mission and was even chosen as an alternate crew member aboard the sloop in 1978. She brought a wealth of educational skills to Clearwater's activities since her background included four years teaching high school English, teaching an undergraduate education class at SUNY Albany, and multiple years working with the National Teacher Corps Project. Papish's recreational skills ran the gamut from canoeing, to sailing, to nautical arts like knot-tying, which made her a valuable addition to Clearwater's efforts. [Nancy Papish Papers. Series 1, Box 2, Folder 8. M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives, University Libraries, University at Albany, State University of New York].\n\n NRFC was one of many organizations that participated in a grassroots campaign to stop Hydro-Quebec's proposed James Bay II project in the early 1990s. New York State contracted with Hydro-Quebec to purchase electric power through 2018. Hydro-Quebec planned to build several dams in the subarctic James Bay region of Quebec. This enraged environmental and human rights activists, who argued that the dams would destroy an ecosystem on which native Cree and Inuit communities depended. In 1994, the New York Power Authority canceled its final contract with Hydro-Quebec.\n\n May 2009 brought double reasons for celebration as the HRSC family commemorated the sloop's fortieth anniversary and Pete Seeger's ninetieth birthday. Both the sloop and the man responsible for her existence were honored in a concert at Madison Square Garden on May 3, 2009, complete with performers from Dar Williams to Joan Baez. [Art Beat. (30 July 2009). \"Pete Seeger's 90th Birthday Blowout on PBS\". Accessed 16 Oct. 2009, http://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/blog/2009/07/pete-seegers-90th-birthday-blowout-on-pbs.html]. The Clearwater's trip up the Hudson River to Albany that spring added to the festive atmosphere as she led a flotilla of boats in honor of Henry Hudson's 1609 exploration.\n\n HRSC is also making strides in a new program called the Next Generation Legacy Project, which focuses on green jobs in a green economy for the 21st century. The project will advance in three phases, the first of which began in spring 2009 with the opening of the Clearwater Center for Environmental leadership in Beacon, NY. The ultimate goal is to open eight green cities/green jobs satellite centers in environmental leadership.

              "content": "The papers document the environmental activism of Nancy Papish from the 1970s through the 1990s, focusing strongly on her involvement with Clearwater and North River Friends of Clearwater, as well as the campaign to stop Hydro-Quebec from building dams in the James Bay region of Quebec. Included are meeting minutes, notes, mailings, press releases, news clippings, magazine articles, programs, posters, and publications. The Clearwater files contain near-complete runs of newsletters produced by both NRFC and the parent Clearwater organization. Evidence of NRFC's outreach activities is found in a slide show titled \"This Is Clearwater\" and numerous poster displays.\n\n Most of the Clearwater files contain information that was disseminated widely to members, such as mailings, brochures, and publications. The \"Clearwater\" series has some documentation of Clearwater's organization and administration, such as meeting minutes and internal reports, though most of the minutes pertain to the parent group HRSC, not North River Friends. There is little information about the membership of Clearwater. Documents pertaining to groups and projects that share Clearwater's interests, but were not produced by Clearwater, make up the majority of the subject files.\n\n Since the campaign to stop development in James Bay was grassroots in nature, the James Bay files contain materials from several organizations. Detail about the structure and history of these organizations is lacking, as well as information about individual participants in the movement.\n\n The papers do not contain much personal correspondence, and biographical information on Papish is equally scarce. Although there are files related to environmental education, there is no documentation of Papish's professional life as an English teacher at Schoharie Central School. There are quite a few subject files pertaining to other environmental groups that Papish supported, as well as groups related to the arts. The collection also features memorabilia, mainly tying in to the Clearwater and its fundraising/awareness activities.\n\n Several collections in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives provide further information on the environmental issues that were of concern to Papish. For a complete list of collections on the subject of conservation and the environment, see http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/conservation.htm. Of particular note are the records of Environmental Advocates of New York, Sierra Club Atlantic Chapter, Environmental Clearinghouse of Schenectady, and the Solidarity Committee of the Capital District (APAP-024), which contain files on the campaign to stop Hydro-Quebec's James Bay project.",

Wetlands are ecosystems intermediate in nature between dry land and open water, such as swamps, bogs, marshes and vernal pools, where there is standing water for at least part of the year, the soils are poorly drained, and the plants are adapted to go without oxygen for extended periods of time. First founded as the New York Wetlands Coalition in 1988, the organization changed its name to the New York State Wetlands Forum in September 1993. Its mission statement declares that it is the task of the group to \"improve communication among people interested in wetlands; call attention to and objectively discuss local, statewide, regional, national and global wetland issues as they relate to New York State; improve its members' knowledge and understanding of wetlands; and make available information about wetlands to its members and the general public.\" Membership is open to the public, and types of members include attorneys, engineers, government officials, and scientists, according to the website New York State Wetlands Forum.\n\n The principal activities of the New York State Wetlands Forum include publishing a bi-annual newsletter, <emph render=\"italic\">The Forum</emph>, tracking changes in state and federal wetlands regulations, communicating new wetlands research, and sponsoring conferences on wetlands. The organization is run by a ten-member Board of Governors, which consists of five officers, the chair, first vice-chair, second vice-chair, treasurer, and secretary, and five at-large members. There have been five chairs: Norbert Quenzer Jr. (1994-1996), Sally Daly (1996-1998), Barbara B. Beall (1998-2000), Jennifer Brady-Connor (2000-2002), and Christine Delorier (2002-Present).",

It began in opposition to American Ref-fuel/BFI's (Brown Ferris Industries and Air Products and Chemical Inc.) proposal to build an incinerator on Cabbage Island (now Beacon Island) in Bethlehem. After defeating the proposed American Ref-fuel/BFI incinerator the group organized with environmentalists from the town of Coeymans against a proposed ANSWERS (Albany New York Solid Waste Energy Recovering System) landfill. In 1992 the EAC (Energy Answers Corporation) proposed building a waste management facility that included an incinerator on Green Island, located in Albany near Troy, or Cabbage Island, the same site that BWOW fought to protect against American Ref-Fuel/BFI's proposal. On June 18, 1992 a referendum vote was held in Bethlehem and rejected EAC's proposal and prohibited the building of incinerators in the town. BWOW advocated the 3 R's: reduce, reuse, and recycle. The group wrote editorials, spoke at public meetings, held public forums, gave talks at schools and for community groups, and organized recycling days for the community. They were the first in the community to organize days for recycling of certain materials such as books, shoes, and latex paints. They mentored the student group Students Reduce Our Trash who put together a lesson plan for the Bethlehem Central School District incorporating the 3 R's. They also formulated a Solid Waste Disposal System for the town of Bethlehem. The group put out extensive information not only about themselves but also about the dangers of incineration. In 1991 the group incorporated as a not-for-profit organization. Money came from member donations and fundraising events. The group ended its efforts in the mid 1990s. The last newsletter was issued in 1995",

The materials in the collection include correspondence between BWOW and members of town and state government as well as other environmentally concerned groups and individuals. There are also numerous news clippings related to the waste management facility proposals BWOW opposed, as well as articles about the group's activities within the town such as recycling days. BWOW also spoke and wrote about the dangers of incineration and promoted waste reduction, reuse, and recycling. There are notes from BWOW meetings and notes from speaking engagements. There are materials related to the three waste management facility proposals BWOW opposed. The files include relevant correspondence, news articles, reports and materials from the companies proposing the waste management facilities. There is also material related to the June 18, 1992 election in Bethlehem in which the EAC proposal was defeated and the town voted to ban incinerators. The collection also includes videos. Some of the videos are home recordings of news programs about the incinerator proposals. Greenpeace produced one of the videos about the dangers of incinerators and community protest against them. The collection is weak in the day-to-day operations of the group. There is little financial information. Files are arranged alphabetically within each series.

              "content": "The Citizens Budget Commission (CBC) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit civic organization devoted to influencing constructive change in the finances and services of New York City and New York State government.[Citizens Budget Commission: About the Citizens Budget Commission, http://www.cbcny.org/about.html Accessed July 18, 2006] The inspiration for the group was New York City's inability to manage its budget. The CBC took on the responsibility of analyzing and evaluating New York City's finances. This information was used to create recommendations and reports designed to help New York City. This responsibility was expanded from New York City to state government in 1984. The CBC believes that the interests of the citizenry of New York is of foremost importance and should guide their actions and responses.[ \"A Profile of the Citizens Budget Commission,\" Series 6, Box 1, Folder 21, 1995.] \n\n The CBC was founded in 1932 during the Great Depression when Jimmy Walker was mayor of New York City. When Fiorello LaGuardia became mayor in 1934, New York City, like the rest of the nation, was in a poor financial position. LaGuardia worked to resolve New York City's financial problems. The CBC offered criticism and advice throughout this period, which is documented in the news clippings in the collection. The CBC conducted research and released reports meant to be unbiased based on the needs of the people and intended to be what was best for New York City. Out of this time of financial struggle grew the Citizens Budget Commission. Another financial crisis in New York City's history occurred in the mid-1970s. A combination of generous welfare spending in the 1960s and a stock market decline in the 1970s put New York City in financial peril. One example of advice the CBC gave New York City during this time was to urge the city to provide only essential services and even at that level to do it economically.[\"Citizens Budget Commission Urges City Provide Only Essential Services, Phase Out 'Pernicious' Practice of Borrowing for Recurring Expenses,\" Series 7, Box 6, Folder 1, April 14, 1975.]\n\n For over seventy years the CBC has acted as the financial voice of reason for New York City and more recently for all of New York State. CBC's changing responsibility to include all of New York State is explained in their 1984 annual report. The CBC became concerned when state government violated rules of state and local finance in their budget practices.[ \"Annual Report: 1984,\" Series 3, Box 1, Folder 16.] The most recent annual report in the records from 1992 reports on a committee the CBC created to research the connection between the City of New York and the rest of the state on fiscal responsibility. Some of the results revealed that New York City is the source of about one-third of the entire state's revenues while 20% of New York City's revenues are received through state aid. This committee was designed to help solve the \"finger pointing\" dilemma that statistics such as these caused between New York City and New York State.[\"60th Anniversary Report: 1932-1992,\" Series 3, Box 1, Folder 17.]\n\n Today the CBC is led by a president who oversees a research and administrative staff. The board of trustees are under the guidance of a ruling chair. The CBC's current function is nearly identical to its purpose in 1932 when it was first created-convincing New York to act wisely with its money.",

              "content": "Bill Babbitt is an activist in the abolition movement. He regularly speaks out against the capital punishment system after promising his younger brother Manny he would campaign to end the death penalty. On May 4, 1999 Bill Babbitt witnessed fifty-year-old Manny Babbitt's execution by the State of California at San Quentin prison.\n\n The sons of an \u00e9migr\u00e9 from the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of western Africa, Manny and Bill Babbitt grew up in a family of eight children in Wareham, Massachusetts. Enlisting in the Marines as a teenager, Manny Babbitt served two tours of duty in Vietnam, including fighting at the siege at Khe Sanh in 1968. He later received a Purple Heart for wounds sustained during his military service in 1998, while a prisoner on Death Row.\n\n In the years following his discharge Manny Babbitt lived in Massachusetts and Rhode Island where he suffered from schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder. According to Carbone, he spent time in psychiatric institutions, failed at relationships, lived periodically on the streets, drank and engaged in drug use, and went to prison for committing increasingly violent crimes. He moved in September 1980 to Sacramento, California to be with his brother Bill and sister-in-law Linda. There Manny Babbitt was ultimately tried and convicted of the murder of an elderly woman, Leah Schendel, who died of cardiac arrest after being severely beaten during a robbery in her home in December 1980.\n\n After discovering his brother might be involved in this crime, Bill Babbitt approached the police and assisted them with the arrest of Manny Babbitt. Bill Babbitt states the authorities promised his brother would receive psychological help and placement in a mental health facility rather than on Death Row. In 1982, however, after being found sane and guilty of murder, Manny Babbitt was sentenced to death. According to Doyle, his family strongly believes that his initial lawyers were not competent nor did they offer post-traumatic stress disorder as part of the defense. While Manny Babbitt never denied committing the crime, he stated he could not remember anything about that night.\n\n During the 1990s Manny Babbitt had a new legal defense team dedicated to trying to appeal his conviction, secure a new trial, and spare his life through legal channels. It was led by public defender and lead counsel Jessica McGuire and a fellow Vietnam veteran and trial attorney Chuck Patterson. In addition to Manny and Bill Babbitt's family and supporters, other Vietnam veterans also petitioned California Governor Gray Davis for clemency in this case. Both legal activity and media coverage of the case intensified in the early months of 1999, leading up to Governor Davis denying clemency, several high courts rejecting last minute appeals and intervention, and Manny Babbitt's subsequent execution.\n\n Bill Babbitt continues to campaign against the death penalty and is frequently interviewed on network television news programs, radio stations, major daily newspapers, and magazines. He attends anti-death penalty rallies, testifies before state legislative committees, and often speaks alongside David Kaczynski, the executive director of New Yorkers Against the Death Penalty, before student and legal groups. David Kaczynski assisted federal authorities with the apprehension of his brother Ted Kaczynski, known as the \"Unabomber.\" The documentaries And Then One Night: The Making of Dead Man Walking with Sister Helen Prejean and Mike Farrell and A Question of Justice, also with David Kaczynski, share the story of Bill and Manny Babbitt.\n\n Bill Babbitt is active in several national organizations that oppose capital punishment. He was a board member of Murder Victims' Families for Reconciliation from 2000-2004 and is a founding board member of Murder Victims' Families for Human Rights, where he still serves today.",

              "content": "Bill Pelke was born in 1947 in Indiana. In 1985, Bill Pelkes grandmother Ruth Elizabeth Pelke, a 78 year old bible school teacher was brutally murdered in her home by a group of high school girls during a robbery. The leader of the group responsible, Paula Cooper (15), was arrested and was found guilty and sentenced to die. At first, Bill Pelke believed this to be a just punishment but later, owing to a realization that his grandmother would show mercy, began advocating for a retraction of Paula Coopers death sentence. In 1989, Paula Coopers sentence was changed from death to 60 years, owing to recent changes in federal and state laws which barred the death penalty for defendants who committed crimes under the age of 16.\n\n Bill Pelke is very active in the death penalty abolition movement both locally and nationally. He is the President/Co-Founder of Journey of Hope From Violence to Healing, that began as a two-week event conducted by Murder Victims Families for Reconciliation (MVFR) in which speakers told the story of their loss and their resolution to oppose the death penalty. Journey of Hope conducted yearly events beginning in 1993 in Indiana, and followed by events in Georgia (1994), California (1995), and Virginia (1996). In 1997, Journey of Hope was spun-off from MVFR and became its own organization called Journey of HopeFrom Violence to Healing. The same year, Bill Pelke who was a member of both boards left MVFR. After its incorporation, Journey of HopeFrom Violence to Healing has organized full two-week events, as well as a number of smaller events, in states throughout the United States and overseas; Philippines (1998), Italy (1998), Europe (1998, 1999), Germany (2009), and Uganda, Rwanda, and Kenya (2011).\n\n Over the last two decades Bill Pelke has been member in various capacities for National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty (NCADP), Murder Victims Families for Human Rights (MVFHR), Alaskans Against the Death Penalty (AADP), Abolitionist Action Committee (AAC), Citizens United for Alternatives to the Death Penalty (CUADP), Indiana Citizens United for the Rehabilitation of Errants (Indiana CURE), Amnesty International, andMurder Victims Families for Reconciliation (MVFR).\n\n Bill Pelke is a retired steelworker, a Vietnam veteran, and a college graduate with a BS degree in Pastoral Theology. He authored the book, Journey of Hopefrom Violence to Healing, which details the murder of his grandmother Ruth Elizabeth Pelke. He currently lives in Alaska and remains involved with the abolitionist movement worldwide.",

              "content": "The Death Penalty in New York Testimony Collection was collected as part of a partnership between the Capital Punishment Research Initiative (CPRI) at the University at Albany's School of Criminal Justice and the University at Albany Libraries. The CPRI, headed by Professors James Acker and Charles Lanier, donated this material in an effort to provide researchers with full coverage of the hearings.\n\n As explained in <emph render=\"italic\">Death Penalty in New York, A Report on Five Public Hearings</emph> (pages 1-4), the New York State Assembly Standing Committees on Codes, Judiciary and Correction held a succession of public hearings in December 2004 through February 2005 on the death penalty in New York in reaction to the June 24, 2004, decision by the New York Court of Appeals to strike down the New York's capital punishment law enacted in 1995. The decision, rendered in People v. LaValle, struck down New York's \"deadlock\" instruction provision, which had been proposed by Governor Pataki and passed by the New York State Senate in 1995. The \"deadlock\" instruction provision ordered juries to be instructed that they give one of only two sentencing options, death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and that they be further instructed that in the event of a jury deadlock that the defendant would be sentenced to a minimum of 20-25 year and a maximum of life imprisonment. It was the decision that jurors might feel coerced into choosing the death penalty to avoid the court deciding to give a defendant a minimum 20-25 year sentence.\n\n When the New York Court of Appeals struck down the \"deadlock\" provision it completely forbade the operation of the death penalty. However, the Court did agree that life without the possibility of parole was a fair alternative sentence. The decision by the New York Court of Appeals left the New York State Assembly the charge to enact legislation that would reinstate the death penalty, modify the death penalty, or abolish the death penalty. The committees acknowledged that the death penalty in New York had been ineffective. The committees recognized that in the ten years since the law was enacted more than $170 million had been spent in pursuit of death penalty cases, yet no one was executed. In total, four sentences were struck down by the New York Court of Appeals, one sentence was converted to life without parole, and two cases were still in the sentencing process. The committees noted that numerous death row exonerations due to DNA testing had been occurring in the previous ten years and also observed a change in public opinion. The New York State Assembly Standing Committees on Codes, Judiciary and Correction decided that it would formally review New York's death penalty law including its history, the needs of defendants, and the wishes of constituents.\n\n The committees heard oral testimony from 146 witnesses and read written testimony from another 24 witnesses, both of which combined to more than 4,000 transcribed pages. The documents in this collection, however, do not give an indication of the New York State Assembly Standing Committees on Codes, Judiciary and Correction's final decision about capital punishment in New York State. However, the Death Penalty Information Center (http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org) indicates that the Assembly did vote to eliminate the death penalty on April 12, 2005. To read the text of Bill A00851, which repeals the death penalty in New York State, see the laws on the New York State Assembly's web site (http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg).",

            "Born in Leavenworth, Kansas, Schein was a pioneer in the development of educational television and radio in New York State. During graduate study at Boston University, he became active in fundraising to help establish Boston's educational television station, WGBH and served on the Massachusetts Citizens Committee on Educational Television. In 1955, Schein came to Schenectady and served as associate producer and first president of the Mohawk-Hudson Council on Educational Television, where he produced instructional programs for in-school use broadcast over WRGB-TV. Schein led the effort to launch the second public television station in New York State, Schenectady's WMHT in 1962, and was executive director and later general manager. He was instrumental in the addition of the all classical music radio station WMHT-FM in 1972 and the Radio Information Service (RISE), a radio reading service for the blind and print handicapped in 1978. He retired in 1986 as general manager, after concluding negotiations for the acquisition of Channel 45, WMHQ. The collection contains newsletters, programs and schedules, meeting minutes, photographs, and Schein's files as president of Mohawk-Hudson Council on Educational Television, and files as executive director and general manager of WMHT."

              "content": "Donald Schein, a pioneer in the development of public broadcasting in New York State, served as executive producer and general manager of WMHT, the Capital District's public television station. Schein was born in Leavenworth, Kansas in 1920 and graduated from high school in Brookline, Massachusetts in 1938. From 1942 to 1945 he served in the Coast Guard. After the war he received a bachelor's degree in English from Northeastern University and a master's degree in American Literature from Boston University, where he taught while working on his Ph.D. dissertation.\n\n In 1953, Schein became interested in the educational potential of television. After taking several courses on broadcasting at Boston University he enrolled in the graduate program in television production at Syracuse University in 1954 and received an M.S. the following year. Following his graduation from Syracuse, Schein was hired as a program producer by the Mohawk-Hudson Council on Educational Television (MHCET), the Capital District's educational television consortium. MHCET had been founded in 1953 under a charter from the New York State Board of Regents, the first such charter to be granted to an educational television council. Initially, MHCET produced educational programs for early-morning broadcast over other local television and radio stations. The Council had an early success with Fun With French, a children's language program.\n\n When station founder Angela McDermott left MHCET in 1956, Schein became executive producer. In 1957, MHCET produced the first for-credit open circuit televised college course in New York State, a University at Albany course on introductory geography. In 1958, in cooperation with the American Chemical Society, MHCET produced a televised course in Basic Russian. Initially intended to teach GE engineers to read Russian technical monographs, the course was a popular success and received nationwide press coverage.\n\n Meanwhile, Schein was working to establish a permanent educational television station for the Capital District. In 1958 MHCET established a fundraising group, Friends of Educational Television, to help finance the establishment a permanent station. The Council eventually acquired its own station, Channel 17, and in March 1962 WMHT began broadcasting out of a converted gym in the basement of the Riverside School in Schenectady. The following year, commercial station WTEN donated a more powerful transmitter, increasing the station's broadcast range.\n\n WMHT was a member of NET (National Educational Television), the predecessor to the Public Broadcasting System, and Schein was active in the national educational broadcasting community. In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act, which established the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The phrase \"public television\" replaced \"educational television\" as the preferred industry term and WMHT became a charter affiliate of the Public Broadcasting System (PBS).\n\n In 1968, WMHT constructed a studio and control room in the State Capitol Building, allowing programs on state government to be produced and broadcast directly from the Capitol. In 1969, the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare donated Building 34 at the Rotterdam Army Depot to WMHT, allowing the station to move out of the Riverside School and into a dedicated state-of-the-art production facility.\n\n In 1971 the station received a gift of land in the Helderbergs to house its transmitter. Two years later the station acquired a new transmitter, increasing its signal power tenfold. The station continued to grow throughout the 1970s, broadcasting national PBS productions such as Masterpiece Theater and producing its own programming for local broadcast and national distribution. Inside Albany, a program on New York State government, began broadcasting in 1975, and in 1979 the program received Columbia University's Alfred I. DuPont Award for excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1978 the station produced Molders of Troy, a historical drama which told the story of the nineteenth-century labor movement from the perspective of an Irish-American family in Troy. That year WMHT also became the first Capital District television station to receive network programming via satellite.\n\n During the 1970s, WMHT expanded into radio. WMHT-FM, the Capital District's only full-time classical music station, went on the air in 1972, and by 1975 it was broadcasting 24 hours a day. WMHT-FM was the first noncommercial station to air an all-classical format. In 1978, WMHT began to transmit the Radio Information Service (RISE), a radio reading service for the visually impaired, and to broadcast NOAA weather radio.\n\n The station continued to grow throughout the 1980s. By 1982 WMHT was broadcasting 24 hours a day, and in 1986 MHCET acquired the commercial UHF station WUSV and turned it into WMHX, a second public television channel. Schein continued to be active in the national public broadcasting community; in 1985 he delivered a well-received speech arguing against corporate underwriting of public television programs.\n\n In 1986 Schein retired as general manager, although he continued to serve as president emeritus for another year. During his departure the station became embroiled in a controversy over the size of its reserve fund, which some critics considered excessive. Following his retirement from WMHT Schein served for a year as the volunteer Executive Director of Proctor's Theatre in Schenectady. He also served as president of the Environmental Clearinghouse of Schenectady and was active in various community organizations. Schein died in 1998.",

              "content": "Following his retirement from WMHT Schein decided to organize his personal and professional papers chronologically for the benefit of future researchers. This order has been maintained in the present arrangement. Folders are arranged by year; within each year they are arranged alphabetically by subject. Occasionally, folders contain material spanning multiple years. In these cases they are filed according to the earliest year they contain and subsequent years are indicated in the folder title.\n\n Many record series in the collection are consistent from year to year. Folders titled \"MHCET Internal Records\" (through 1961) and \"WMHT Internal Records\" (1962 and after) contain the internal records of the Mohawk-Hudson Council on Educational Television (MHCET) and its broadcast station WMHT. These records primarily document the administrative history of the station via meeting minutes, correspondence, reports and memoranda. They contain relatively few records of the production of particular series or of the day-to-day operation of the station.\n\n Folders titled \"Educational Television\" (through 1966) and \"Public Broadcasting\" (1967 and after) contain material received by WMHT in its capacity as a member station of various educational television and public broadcasting organizations, including the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB), the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and the Public Broadcasting System (PBS). This material consists primarily of reports, newsletters, internal circulars, memoranda and similar gray literature.\n\n The collection also includes large although not always complete collections of various trade periodicals, including Public Telecommunications Review, Educational and Industrial Television, Current and Access, as well as numerous bound reports and publications from MHCET/WMHT and from national public broadcasting organizations. These items are filed alphabetically by title within their year of publication.\n\n Schein kept a journal on looseleaf paper throughout much of his adult life. During his career at WMHT, these journals described meetings and work activities. Following his retirement their contents became more personal and reflective. The collection also includes Schein's Day-Timer pocket planners and associated expense sheets for the years 1976-1995. These journals and Day-Timers are found under the appropriate heading within each year.\n\n The collection includes a complete run of WMHT's monthly program guide from its beginning in 1963 through 2005. This guide has been indexed within each year according to its title, which varied over time. The titles are:\n\n 1963-1973 Scene on 17\n\n 1973-1982 The WMHT Program Guide\n\n 1983-1985 WMHT\n\n 1985-1989 Capital Region\n\n 1989-1990 Capital\n\n 1991 Program Guide\n\n 1991-2002 Prelude\n\n 2002-2005 Outlook\n\n In addition, the collection includes many subject files which varied from year to year:\n\n 1920-1954 : These years encompass Donald Schein's life before he joined the staff of the Mohawk-Hudson Council on Educational Television (MHCET). Material from these years includes personal correspondence, a draft of Schein's Ph.D. dissertation at Boston University, and notes and readings from the Syracuse University graduate program in broadcasting.\n\n 1955-1961 : This period covers Schein's years with the Mohawk-Hudson Council on Educational Television (MHCET) prior to the establishment of WMHT. These years include material on the Basic Russian program (1958), notes on various MHCET series, materials received from other educational television stations, and publications on educational television. Of particular note is Producing Your Educational Television Program, a 1961 instructional manual published by MHCET.\n\n 1962-1967 : These years span the time between the establishment of WMHT and the creation of the national Public Broadcasting Service in 1967. Material from these years primarily documents the growth and development of WMHT.\n\n 1968-1978 : These years cover the first decade of WMHT's participation in the Public Broadcasting System. The extensive Public Broadcasting files contain internal memoranda, circulars and messages from the national PBS offices. Internal WMHT records include material related to the establishment of WMHT-FM in 1972 and the RISE reading service in 1978. The year 1976 contains extensive material related to Schein's attendance of a Harvard Business School seminar hosted by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\n 1979-1987 : These years cover the bulk of WMHT's second decade as a PBS affiliate. They document the purchase of WUSV, the retirement of Donald Schein in 1986, and the station's 25th anniversary celebration in 1987. The WMHT internal records for 1987 include an extensive assortment of clippings and correspondence regarding the controversy over WMHT's station fund. The year 1987 also includes material from Donald Schein's project to compile a video history of the station, including numerous interview transcripts.\n\n 1988-2005 : The collection covers the years following Schein's retirement in less detail, but it continues to include complete runs of WMHT's monthly program as well as some internal material, such as board minutes and annual reports, received by Schein following his retirement. It also includes a small assortment of material related to Proctor's Theatre, where Schein served as volunteer executive director in 1988.\n\n Photographs : The collection contains approximately 1 cubic foot of photographic material which was maintained as a separate series. These photographs largely consist of promotional photographs from the first decade of MHCET's existence and include numerous photographs of MHCET series such as Fun With French and TV Schooltime. The series also includes a smaller assortment of promotional photographs from later years, including a photograph of Schein with Governor Nelson Rockefeller and Lieutenant Governor Malcolm Wilson.",

              "content": "Oskar Maria Graf was born on July 22, 1894 in Berg on Lake Starnberg in Bavaria, Germany. He was the youngest son of the eight surviving children of baker Max Graf and Therese Heimrath. Graf's father was successful as a baker, providing a comfortable home and surroundings for the Graf family. Oskar entered elementary school in Berg in 1900, however shortly after his father's death in 1905, he began an apprenticeship in the family bakery under his older brother Max. Although Oskar endured nearly five years under the strict supervision of his brother, in 1911, to escape the beatings of his brother, he ran away to Munich where he joined a Bohemian group. He made connections with the anarchist circle \"Die Tat\" and in 1912 tramped to the Tessin region in southern Switzerland to join an anarchist colony. He became disillusioned with the colony and returned to Munich. During this time, supporting himself with odd jobs, he began to write poems and short stories. It wasn't until 1914, however, that he was able to get several of his poems published in the expressionist periodical <emph render=\"italic\">Die Aktion</emph> (Berlin).\n\n Graf was drafted into the German army in 1915 to serve on the Eastern Front. Graf went on a hunger strike, feigning insanity, until he was finally committed to a mental institution. By 1916, he was both released from the mental institution and discharged from military service. Graf returned to Munich where he worked in a factory and wrote reviews for the Munich newspaper <emph render=\"italic\">M\u00fcnchen-Augsburg Abendzeitung</emph>. In 1918, Graf published his first major work, <emph render=\"italic\">Wir sind Revolution\u00e4re</emph>, married his first wife, Karoline Bretting, with whom he had a daughter, his only child, Annemarie, a year later. In 1918, he also met Mirjam Sachs, the cousin of poetess Nelly Sachs, who would later become his second wife. Later in the same year, he took part in anti-war demonstrations, and in 1919 participated in a revolution which resulted in the short-lived Soviet Bavarian Republic, and, after its defeat, was imprisoned for his participation.\n\n In 1920 Graf became the dramatic producer of the Socialist worker's theater \"Die neue B\u00fchne\" in Munich, and in 1922, published both <emph render=\"italic\">Fr\u00fchzeit</emph> and <emph render=\"italic\">Zur freundlichen Erinnerung</emph>, with his <emph render=\"italic\">Bayrisches Leseb\u00fccherl</emph> following in 1924. It wasn't until 1927, however, that Graf gained international recognition with the publication <emph render=\"italic\">Wir sind Gefangene</emph>. Graf continued to write, publishing <emph render=\"italic\">Das bayrische Dekameron</emph> in 1928 and <emph render=\"italic\">Kalender-Geschichten</emph> in 1929, followed by of <emph render=\"italic\">Bolwieser: Roman eines Ehemanns</emph> in 1931 and <emph render=\"italic\">Notizbuch des Provinzschriftstellers Oskar Maria Graf</emph> in 1932.\n\n In the early months of 1933 Graf was on a lecture tour in Austria. It was during this time, shortly after Hitler's rise to power, that the Nazis ordered the first of the book burnings. With the exception of <emph render=\"italic\">Prisoner's All</emph>, however, Graf's books were recommended rather than burned by the Nazi regime. This prompted Graf to write his famous \"Verbrennt mich!\" (\"Burn me too\"), perhaps one of the most famous anti-Nazi statements, which was published in the <emph render=\"italic\">Wiener Arbeiter-Zeitung</emph> on May 22, 1933. Graf remained in Austria in exile, where he lived until 1934, working as co-editor of the German expatriate journal <emph render=\"italic\">Neue deutsche Bl\u00e4tter</emph>. In 1934, after having participated in a political uprising of Austrian workers against the Engelbert Dollfuss regime, Graf escaped to (Brno) Czechoslovakia, where he remained until 1938. He left for a short period to attend the First Congress of Socialist Writers in Moscow, but returned to Brno where he continued to write. Graf's novel <emph render=\"italic\">Anton Sittinger</emph> was published in 1937 by the German exile publishing company Malik in London.\n\n In 1938, Graf left Europe without his wife and child and fled to New York City. Mirjam Sachs followed Graf to New York, however it wasn't until 1944 that Karoline agreed to a divorce and the couple finally married. Graf's only daughter, Annemarie, remained in Germany to be raised by his mother, and eventually joined a German Youth organization under Hitler called the Bund Deutscher M\u00e4dchen (BDM). Graf, who was vehemently opposed to Hitler, was never close to his daughter and there are no letters in the collection between Graf and his daughter. While in New York, Graf made speeches before German-American groups and wrote regularly for the New York City German-language newspaper <emph render=\"italic\">Aufbau</emph>, edited by his wife's brother, Manfred George. He also became president of the German-American Writer's Association during this period.\n\n For a short time Graf lived in the artist colony Yaddo, near Saratoga Springs in upstate New York, where he completed work on the German version of his novel <emph render=\"italic\">The Life of My Mother</emph> (<emph render=\"italic\">Das Leben meiner Mutter</emph>), which portrayed life in Germany from the Bismarck era to the time of Hitler. He followed this with the publication of <emph render=\"italic\">Unruhe um einen Friedfertigen</emph>, the story of a Jewish cobbler killed by the Nazis after having lived for many years fully integrated into the life of a Bavarian village.\n\n Graf was unable to return to Germany immediately following the war. Not only had the Hitler regime revoked his German citizenship, but he was also unwilling to sign American citizenship papers because it would require him to bear arms. Finally in 1958, after the removal of the clause on bearing arms, Graf became an American citizen, and with his American passport, he was able to revisit Germany, and did so four times before his death.\n\n Graf's second wife, Mirjam, died in 1959 after a long battle with breast cancer. He never wished to return permanently to Germany, claiming he did not like the \"New Germany\" and having become extremely comfortable in his exile home of New York. He never mastered the English language, primarily because as a writer he wanted his German to remain \"pure\". He established a regular German \"Stammtisch\" called \"Die blaue Donau\" in New York, and in 1962, married fellow exile Gisela Blauner, who had earned her Ph.D. in jurisprudence in Germany before being exiled. In 1964 Graf became corresponding member of the German Akademie der K\u00fcnste (Academy for Arts) in Berlin.\n\n Oskar Maria Graf died on June 25, 1967 in New York City of complications arising from pneumonia. His ashes were buried a year later in Munich, June 28, 1968.

              "content": "Walter Friedl\u00e4nder, born in 1891 in Berlin, was a prominent leader of the reform movement in the fields of social policy, social welfare and public health in Weimar (pre-Hitler) Germany. Friedl\u00e4nder, an active Social Democrat and a Jew, was forced to flee Nazi Germany in March of 1933, and eventually immigrated to the United States via France, where he continued to play a leading role as an educator and leader in the field of social work and social welfare education in this country.\n\n Walter Friedl\u00e4nder was born on September 20, 1891 in Berlin, the oldest son of Hugo and Ernestine (Lichtenstein) Friedl\u00e4nder. He grew up under the socialist-oriented influences of his father, a founding member of the pacifist Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft, and later under the influences of his uncle, socialist politician Hugo Haase. In autobiographical statements, Friedl\u00e4nder describes the influences of the youth movements (Jugendbewegung) in Weimar Germany and his membership in the Sozialistischer Studentbund during his student years in Berlin. As a law student in Berlin and Munich (1910-1914), Friedl\u00e4nder became interested in the development of juvenile justice and volunteered his time doing probation work. He also met and later became engaged to Li Bergmann (1914), also involved in the youth movement in Berlin, and they were married in February 1919.\n\n Friedl\u00e4nder served in the German army from 1916 to 1918, and after his return to Berlin in 1919 became actively involved in politics. He was first elected as a delegate for the USPD (Independent Social Democrats) to the district assembly in Schmargendorf in 1920, and in April 1921, to district councilor in the Prenzlauer Berg section of Berlin.\n\n Friedl\u00e4nder's first involvement with the field of youth welfare and social work was through the juvenile justice movement, which was just gaining momentum in Berlin around the time he began his legal studies. His teachers included Paul Kahl and Franz von Liszt, leaders in the juvenile justice movement. The influence of Liszt and his daughter, Elsa von Liszt, led to Friedl\u00e4nder's involvement in the Deutsche Zentrale f\u00fcr Jugendf\u00fcrsorge, a private youth welfare organization in Berlin, where he at first participated on a voluntary basis, and later served an internship during the first two years of World War I.\n\n Social democratic policy regarding youth welfare was developed in Germany after 1918 by a relatively small group of individuals, among them Hans Caspari, Marie Juchacz, Helene Simon and Walter Friedl\u00e4nder. The central idea of social democratic youth welfare policy was the child's right to education and material assistance provided by the state, set up by the Arbeiterwohlfahrt, the workers' welfare organization founded by the Social Democrats in 1919. The Fachkommission f\u00fcr Jugendwohlfahrt (Youth Welfare Commission), created in 1925 and attached to the headquarters of Arbeiterwohlfahrt, was chaired by Friedl\u00e4nder from 1925 until his dismissal in 1933. Its members included Helene Simon, Hedwig Wachenheim, Hans Maier, Otto Krebs, Rudolf Schlosser and Louise Schr\u00f6der. The youth welfare committee drafted parliamentary resolutions for the SPD, formulated reform proposals and compiled reports on problems of youth welfare. In addition, the intent was to provide youth welfare committee members with representation at major youth welfare conferences and on central committees of the established youth welfare organizations. Friedl\u00e4nder also became Chairman of the Deutsche Zentrale f\u00fcr freie Jugendwohlfahrt in 1931.\n\n In his twelve years as District Councilor and Director of Youth Welfare in Prenzlauer Berg, the district gained a reputation for developing new and innovative programs in social, and especially youth, welfare, with particular emphasis on the areas of juvenile delinquency (rehabilitation) and youth unemployment.\n\n Friedl\u00e4nder escaped from Germany in February 1933, ostensibly to attend an international conference of the International League of Social Welfare in Geneva in March of 1933. He was officially dismissed from his position in March 1933 and remained in Switzerland after the conference, where his wife and young daughter joined him in May.\n\n He left for Paris in June 1933 at the invitation of the French Minister of Education, however his promise of employment evaporated with the fall of the French cabinet. Instead, Friedl\u00e4nder became co-director of a legal counseling service for political refugees from Germany and helped to set up other organizations to aid his fellow refugees. With the aid of a fellow political refugee from Germany, (John) Otto Reinemann, who had emigrated to the U.S. in 1934, Friedl\u00e4nder received an invitation to lecture at the University of Chicago in 1936 and left Paris in December of the same year.\n\n The Friedl\u00e4nders arrived in Chicago in January 1937, where Walter lectured in the Department of Social Welfare of the University of Chicago until 1943. He also worked as a librarian for the Chicago Jewish vocational service and, at the same time, set up a refugee organization, Selfhelp for Immigrants, patterned after a similar organization founded by Paul Tillich in New York.\n\n In 1943, the same year he became an American citizen, Friedl\u00e4nder left Chicago to lecture at the University of California in Berkeley, where he eventually became professor in the School of Social Welfare and taught until his emeritation in 1959.\n\n Although Friedl\u00e4nder's career in the U.S. became less politically active, he continued to maintain his contacts with Social Democrats and members of the Arbeiterwohlfahrt in post-war Germany, and his correspondence with U.S. politicians is evidence to his continued interest in political affairs.\n\n Friedl\u00e4nder's primary focus in the U.S. became his teaching and writing. Social work training had always been a strong concern for Friedl\u00e4nder during his tenure as Stadtrat (Councilor) in Prenzlauer Berg (Berlin) and teaching consumed a considerable portion of his energies even during this time period. In addition to pursuing an active teaching career at the Social Welfare Departments of the University of Chicago and the University of California, Berkeley, Friedl\u00e4nder continued to publish monographs and later textbooks in the field of social work and social welfare. His most successful work, Introduction to Social Welfare (first published in 1955, and reprinted in 1957, 1968, 1974 and 1979), became the standard basic textbook for social welfare courses throughout the United States. Friedl\u00e4nder also continued to pursue his interest in comparative social work, as evidenced both in his active participation in numerous international social welfare conferences, as well as his publications (including Concepts and Methods of Social Work, 1958 and 1976, and International Social Welfare, 1975).\n\n Walter Friedl\u00e4nder\n\n Chronology of Events: <chronlist><chronitem><date>1891</date><event>20 September, born in Berlin.

Friedl\u00e4nder (Friedlander) Papers consist of 45 archival boxes of materials, dating primarily from 1932 to 1984, with a small number of items dating from as early as 1914. The largest part (nearly two-thirds) of the collection is comprised of Friedl\u00e4nder's voluminous correspondence (30 boxes). The collection also contains biographical materials, manuscripts and publications by Friedl\u00e4nder, as well as course materials and materials pertaining to national and international social welfare conferences, publications by other scholars, and materials collected by Friedl\u00e4nder on topics of interest, particularly social welfare topics.\n\n The collection is divided into nine series: 1) biographical materials; 2) correspondence; 3) manuscripts; 4) publications; 5) conference materials; 6) course and lecture materials; 7) offprints and publications by other scholars; 8) materials collected by Friedl\u00e4nder; and 9) diplomas.\n\n The voluminous correspondence, dating primarily from 1932-1984, contains over 40,000 letters predominantly by and to Walter A. Friedl\u00e4nder. The major portion of the correspondence is professional in nature and includes correspondences with numerous prominent professionals in the fields of social work and social welfare, correspondence with social welfare organizations, government officials and politicians, and correspondence concerning publications by Friedl\u00e4nder.\n\n Friedl\u00e4nder's publications are also well-represented in the collection with typescript and manuscript versions of many of his published writings, as well as published versions of his books and journal articles. Included in the collection of manuscripts and published works are many early articles (1926-1933), which were written by Friedl\u00e4nder during his years as Head of the Youth Welfare Commission in the Prenzlauer-Berg section of the city of Berlin, Germany.\n\n Also noteworthy to the collection is the section containing materials pertaining to various conferences, predominantly on social work/welfare. Especially well-represented are the International Conferences on Social Work / Welfare (1937-1974), especially the Munich Conference of 1956.\n\n In addition, the collection also contains a large number of supporting materials on topics in social work and social welfare, which Friedl\u00e4nder collected to support his research interests. These include offprints and publications by other scholars, course and lecture notes, and clipping/materials files on individuals or topics.",

Dr. Pribram also lectured at the University of Vienna, was Professor of Economics at the University of Frankfurt am Main from 1928 to 1933, and later at American University in Washington, D.C.\n\n Pribram's extensive writings cover topics in labor economics, industrial organization and in the history of economic thought. His works include <emph render=\"italic\">Unification of Social Insurance</emph> (1925), <emph render=\"italic\">Cartel Problems; An Analysis of Collective Monopolies in Europe with American Application</emph> (1935), <emph render=\"italic\">Social Insurance in Europe and Social Security in the United States</emph> (1937), <emph render=\"italic\">Foreign Trade Policy of Austria</emph> (1945), <emph render=\"italic\">Conflicting Patterns of Thought</emph> (1949), and his posthumously published <emph render=\"italic\">A History of Economic Reasoning</emph> (1983).

              "content": "Otto Kirchheimer was born November 11, 1905 in Heilbronn, Germany, fourth son of Julias Kirchheimer and Friederike (Baer) Kirchheimer. He attended school in Heilbronn and Ettenheim, then attended the Universities of Muenster, Berlin, Koeln and Bonn, graduating magna cum laude from the latter in 1928. With his new law degree in hand he became a contributor to Die Gesellschaft and a lecturer in Political Science at German Trade Union Schools. He practiced law in Berlin from 1932 to 1933, leaving Germany in 1933 (he was briefly arrested) because of his Social Democratic Party work.\n\n The next four years were spent in Paris writing and doing research for the International Institute of Social Research. It is here he started rewriting George Rusche's work <emph render=\"italic\">Punishment and Social Structure</emph> for the Institute. This Rusche-Kirchheimer version of <emph render=\"italic\">Punishment and Social Structure</emph> was published in 1939.\n\n In 1937 Kirchheimer arrived in the United States while his wife Hilde, from whom he had been separated for years, and daughter Hanna remained in Europe. His marriage ended a few years later in divorce. While in New York, he continued to work for the International Institute of Social Research (Horchheimer Institute) as a research assistant in law and social science and lecturing in the Institute's program at Columbia University.\n\n In 1943, Kirchheimer moved from New York to Washington, D.C. with his second wife Anne Rosenthal, who later bore his second child, Peter. He took a position as a part-time research analyst at the Research and Analysis Branch of the U. S. Office of Strategic Services. He remained employed with the OSS and later the State Department for thirteen years, eventually directing the total research activities of the Central European Branch. While at the State Department, Kirchheimer accepted part-time teaching positions at American University and Howard University. He left the State Department in 1955 to teach full time, accepting a professorship in the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research.\n\n Kirchheimer stayed at the New School for five years, teaching and writing his second book <emph render=\"italic\">Political Justice: The Use of Legal Procedures for Political Ends</emph>. In 1961, Kirchheimer accepted a position teaching at Columbia and continued to write for political science journals, contributed to books, and prepared position papers for international conferences. On November 22, 1965, while boarding a plane at Dulles airport on his way to teach at Columbia, Otto Kirchheimer suffered a fatal heart attack.\n\n Chronology of Events <chronlist><chronitem><date>November 11, 1905</date><event>Born in Heilbronn to Julias and Frederike (Baer) Kirchheimer</event></chronitem><chronitem><date>1912-1924</date><event>Attended school in Heilbronn, Heidelberg, Ettenheim</event></chronitem><chronitem><date>1924-1928</date><event>Studied at the Universities of Muenster, Berlin, Koeln, Bonn</event></chronitem><chronitem><date>1928</date><event>Law degree (Dr. Jur.) magna cum laude, University of Bonn</event></chronitem><chronitem><date>19??</date><event>Married Hilde Rosenfeld</event></chronitem><chronitem><date>1930</date><event>Daughter, Hanna, born.</event></chronitem><chronitem><date>1930-1933</date><event>Contributed to Die Gesellschaft and lectured on Political Science at German Trade Union School</event></chronitem><chronitem><date>1932-1933</date><event>Practiced law in Berlin</event></chronitem><chronitem><date>1933-1937</date><event>Researcher in the Paris Branch of the International Institute of Social Research (Horkheimer Institute).

His correspondence shows a great interest in the emerging German nation and its new constitution, influential political parties and trade unions.\n\n Kirchheimer's correspondence reveals a man very much respected by German politicians like Fritz Erler, one-time presidential candidate and Carlo Schmid, former vice-president of the German Bundestag. He remained in contact with Gerhard Schulz, labor leader, Ernst Friesenhahn, federal constitutional judge, and Adolf Arndt, long-time member of the Bundestag. Kirchheimer also corresponded with many other intellectuals world-wide. These include Arthur Bergman, Charles David, Horst Ehmke, Ernst Fraenkel, Arkadij Gurland, Arnold Heidenheimer, Wilhelm Hennis, Gerhard Kramer, Gerhard Loewenberg, Karl Loewenstein, Val Lorwin, Harvey Mansfield, Herbert Marcuse, Franz Neumann, Helge Pross, Helmut Ridder, Richard Schmid, and Rudolf Smend. His correspondence files include two letters from Hannah Arendt and one from Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter.\n\n The collection contains correspondence with colleagues, publishers and students (1927-1965). It includes numerous book reviews written by Kirchheimer (1937-1965), reviews and offprints published by his colleagues and associates (1913-1964), as well as extensive research notes on the social and political context of law. The collection also includes much of his personal library. Listings of his offprint collection, book reviews, and pamphlets, as well as a list of the books held in Otto Kirchheimer's personal library are in the autobiographical file.",

              "content": "Fritz W. Neugass (pseudonyms Fran\u00e7ois Neuville and Friedrich Brenatano) was born on the 28th of March 1899 in Mannheim, Baden, Germany to a Protestant-Jewish family. In 1917, he finished school in Mannheim with an end examination (an \"Arbitur\"), which granted him permission to study at a university. During this time, Neugass was briefly a member of the Wandervogel movement. The following year, Neugass volunteered to serve in the Army. His military career was quickly ended when he was buried in rubble after an engagement with the enemy. Neugass spent the rest of the war in an army hospital, and then as a censor for the post office.\n\n From 1919 to 1924, Neugass was a student of Art and Archeology in Heidelberg (1919-1920), Munich (1920), Berlin (1920-1921), and Bonn (1922-1923). He received his Ph.D. in Heidelberg in 1924. Neugass' dissertation discussed Gothic pews, and was printed in Strassburg within a series of art historical studies. Shortly thereafter, Neugass found employment as a lab assistant at the German Archeological Institute in Rome, and at the German Institute for history in Florence. During this time, he participated in many archeological excavations in Italy.\n\n Neugass spent the years 1926 to 1939 as a resident of Paris, where he worked as an art correspondent for German and Swiss newspapers and art magazines, such as <emph render=\"italic\">Berliner Tageblatt</emph>, <emph render=\"italic\">Vossische Zeitung</emph>, <emph render=\"italic\">Weltkunst</emph>, and others. After 1933, his work was no longer accepted in Germany. This led Neugass to work for various American, British, and French periodicals. He often used the pseudonyms Fran\u00e7ois Neuville and Friedrich Brenatano at this time. Much of Neugass' time was spent in the nations around the Mediterranean, where he took a large number of photographs.\n\n In 1939, French authorities labeled Neugass an \"enemy alien\" and interned him in Antibes and in Les Milles. Neugass later wrote a novel about his experiences in the French detention camps. In 1940, he arrived in Free France (Cannes), and applied unsuccessfully for an American visa through the Emergency Rescue Commission of Varian Fry. Nevertheless, Neugass managed to emigrate to the United states via Casablanca in December 1941 just before a Vichy court found Neugass guilty of \"enemy propaganda\".\n\n Shortly after his arrival in the U.S., Neugass worked as a swimming instructor and as a nurse. He made various unsuccessful applications to join the U.S. Army or to work in the war industry. While taking night-classes to learn blueprint drawing, Neugass performed volunteer work for the Red Cross of New York City. Not long before the end of the War, Neugass joined the NYC Patrol Corps. He also worked with the Volunteer Service Photographers (who aided paraplegic G.I.'s with photography).\n\n In 1944, Neugass married Lotte Labus, who had earned her own Ph.D in Berlin. Labus and Neugass had met in the U.S. When the War ended, Neugass became a free-lance photographer. He published photos and articles in American and European photo magazines, such as <emph render=\"italic\">Aufbau</emph>, <emph render=\"italic\">New Yorker</emph>, <emph render=\"italic\">New Yorker Staats- Zeitung und Herold</emph>, and <emph render=\"italic\">Art News</emph>. He became a member of the American Society of Magazine Photographers, and had an exhibition of his work at the Village Camera Club. In 1954, the American Museum of Natural History held an exhibit of several dozen photographs that Neugass had taken in Mexico the previous year.\n\n After 1947, Neugass re-established contact with various German newspapers and magazines, and became a correspondent on the subjects of art, architecture, the art market, and photography. He later became a permanent contributor to the <emph render=\"italic\">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</emph>, <emph render=\"italic\">Handelsblatt</emph>, and other European art and photography magazines. Neugass often wrote for the American art magazine <emph render=\"italic\">Art Voices</emph>.\n\n In January 1979, Neugass was forced to turn down an offer to act as the American editor for a new German magazine (<emph render=\"italic\">Art</emph>) due to poor health. He passed away in June. A memorial exhibit of Neugass' work was held on the 15th of October 1979 at the Goethe House of New York City.\n\n Exhibits of photography by Fritz Neugass:\n\n 1954: American Museum of Natural History exhibit of photographs that were taken by Fritz Neugass in Mexico in 1953.\n\n 1959 (July-August): Chautauqua Art Association Gallery exhibit of photographs by Fritz Neugass.\n\n (ca. 1959): Village Camera Club exhibit of photographs that were taken by Fritz Neugass in New York City and in Europe.\n\n 1979 (October 15): Goethe House of New York City memorial exhibit of photographs by Fritz Neugass.\n\n Sources\n\n Roder, Werner.

              "content": "Fritz Neugass was a professional photographer and journalist as early as 1926, when he first moved to Paris. He was active almost until the day of his death in 1979. The earliest photographs in the collection (not including his personal family pictures) date from the 1930s (few of these images have specific dates written on them.) The dates for the entire collection of papers and photographs range from 1913 to 1979. There are many gaps in time for this collection, which is to be expected in a set of personal papers.\n\n The basic arrangement of the Neugass Papers was completed by Lotte Neugass prior to their deposit at the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections. The collection was divided two main sections. Section one contains mostly typewritten notes (in German and in English), photographs, books, and clippings from periodicals. This material relates to various museum art exhibits and art auctions that took place from the early 1950s to the 1970s. Other papers discuss the work of well-known artists and styles of art, as well as contemporary news events. Much, if not most, of the above material apparently served as sources for articles that were written by Neugass. The second section, almost exclusively photographs, includes personal family pictures, views in and around New York City, images from his travels overseas (and his days as a photojournalist in the 1930s), studies of patterns and faces, prints by other photographers, and mounted images for his exhibits of images from NYC and Mexico. As few of these prints have any dates, they have been organized largely by subject. There are approximately 4500 original photographs by Neugass in the collection.\n\n The Neugass Papers have been divided into sixteen series. The first nine series (corresponding to section one of the Lotte Neugass arrangement) consist of typewritten texts by Neugass in English and German, photographs (not taken by Neugass) used by Neugass to accompany his articles, and clippings used by Neugass in his writing. The series are arranged by subject: Series 1: Art and Artists; Series 2: Museums &amp; Private Collections; Series 3: Art market, art auctions; Series 4: Architecture &amp; Architects; Series 5: Furniture and Design; Series 6: Theater and Film; Series 7: Photography and Photographers; Series 8: General journalistic articles; and Series 9: Articles with text and photos by Neugass. The remaining series include: Series 10: Published writings by Neugass, 1942-1979; Series 11: Early writings (pre-US) of Fritz Neugass, 1930s-1940; Series 12: Documents and biographical materials, 1899-1979; Series 13: Correspondence, 1941-1979; Series 14: Photographs by Fritz Neugass, 1930s-1970s; Series 15: Photographs by other artists; Series 16: Sotheby Parke-Bernet auction catalogs, 1931-1979.",

              "content": "Frank Moore, a New York State politician and civil servant, held a wide range of elected and appointed positions during his fifty-year career. He served as State Comptroller from 1942 to 1950 and as Lieutenant Governor from 1951 to 1953. An expert on municipal law and finance, Moore was described by Governor Nelson Rockefeller as \"the leading authority in this state, and throughout the country, on the subject of local government\" [Nelson A. Rockefeller to Frank Moore, 18 July 1968, Box 20, Folder 12].\n\n Moore was born in Toronto in 1896. Later that year his family moved to Kenmore, N.Y., a suburb of Buffalo, where he graduated from high school in 1914. When the United States entered World War I Moore volunteered for the U.S. Army but was discharged from the officers' training program for being underweight. He then volunteered for the Royal Canadian Air Force, from which he later transferred to the British Royal Air Force.\n\n Moore attended Hobart College and the University of Buffalo Law School. While studying law at Buffalo he served as clerk of the Village of Kenmore. After his admission to the bar in 1924 he established a practice in Kenmore and became counsel to the town, village and school district of that name, beginning his lifelong engagement with the problems of municipal organization in New York State. From 1927 to 1932 he served as counsel to the New York State Joint Legislative Committee on the Revision of the Town Law and was one of the principal authors of the final revision enacted in 1932.\n\n In 1933, Moore helped establish the New York State Association of Towns and became its executive secretary. That year he also became a partner of the New York City-based firm of Dillon, Vandewater and Moore. For the rest of the decade Moore continued to practice law and to direct the Association of Towns, which issued a number of reports and sponsored a well-attended training program for town and county officers. In 1938 he served as a delegate to the State Constitutional Convention.\n\n In 1941 Moore ran for State Comptroller in a special election following the death of the incumbent, Democrat Morris S. Tremaine, but was defeated by Tremaine's interim replacement, Joseph V. O'Leary of the American Labor Party. The following year Moore ran again for State Comptroller and was elected. He served as Comptroller from 1943 to 1950. During his time as Comptroller Moore was responsible for a number of major projects, including the equalization of state assessment rates and the Moore Commission plan to share state revenues with localities on a per capita basis.\n\n In 1950 Moore ran for Lieutenant Governor as part of incumbent Governor Thomas Dewey's slate of Republican candidates. He was elected to the position and served until 1953. In 1953 he resigned from the position to take up the chairmanship of the Government Affairs Foundation, a foundation established by Nelson Rockefeller. He would hold this position for the next fifteen years until the dissolution of the Foundation in 1968. Concurrently with his service at the Foundation Moore served as Chairman of the Local Government Advisory Board of the Office for Local Government, an executive branch agency of New York State.\n\n Moore holds the distinction of being one of two people to serve as a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Conventions of both 1938 and 1967 [News clipping, Box 11, Folder 12]. At the 1938 convention he served as Chairman of the Villages Committee. During the late 1950s Moore served on the Temporary State Commission on the 1959 Constitutional Convention, which was established by Governor Harriman to prepare for a possible 1959 convention. When the voters rejected the call for a convention, the commission was transformed into the Special Legislative Committee on the Revision and Simplification of the Constitution, which continued to meet and issue reports.\n\n During his career Moore chaired or served on a wide range of commissions, conferences and committees in New York State and in the United States. Moore served as chairman of the State Board of Equalization and Assessment, the Committee on Constitutional Tax and Debt Limitations and City-School Fiscal Relations (CTDL-CSFR), the New York State Advisory Committee on Teachers' Salaries, the Committee on Special Local Non-Property Taxes, the New York State Temporary Commission on School Buildings, the Commission on Municipal Revenues and the Reduction of Real Estate Taxes, the State-Local Advisory Committee on Public Works, the Temporary State Commission on Per Capita Aid, and the State Commission on Governmental Operations of the City of New York (the Moore Commission) on New York City finances. In 1955 he chaired the Finance Committee of President Eisenhower's White House Conference on Education, and in 1956 he chaired the National Conference on Metropolitan Problems. Moore was also a member of the American Council to Improve Our Neighborhoods (A.C.T.I.O.N.) and a member of the Board of Overseers of the Alfred Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University.\n\n Moore gradually retired from public service in the late 1960s for reasons of health. The Government Affairs Foundation was disbanded in 1968. Moore died in 1978 in Crystal River, Florida.\n\n Timeline: <chronlist><chronitem><date>1896</date><event>Frank Charles Moore born in Toronto.

They have been arranged into ten series, plus several subseries, according to the original order of the papers and the various positions which Moore held.\n\n The collection consists primarily of the records of Moore's service in various elected and appointed positions. Materials include correspondence, memoranda, draft and final reports, research material, periodicals, photographs, meeting minutes and news clippings. Many series contain extensive files of internal research and reports that document the statistical information which guided the decision-making of Moore and his colleagues. The records of the Committee on Constitutional Tax and Debt Limitations and City-School Fiscal Relations (CTDL-CSFR), for example, contain numerous annually issued binders of statistical information on relevant subjects, while the records of the Special Legislative Committee on the Revision and Simplification of the Constitution contain extensive internal reports on the municipal government of several New York State cities. Most series also contain subject files which document the general activities of the various offices.\n\n The collection contains extensive files of material on each of the major positions which Moore held during his career: Executive Secretary of the State Association of Towns (1933-1940), New York State Comptroller (1942-1950), New York State Lieutenant Governor (1951-1953), and Chairman of the Government Affairs Foundation (1953-1968). In addition, it contains the records of numerous conferences, commissions and committees on which Moore served, as well as records documenting his service as member and eventual Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the State University of New York (1948-1965) and his participation in the 1938, 1959 and 1967 efforts to revise the New York State Constitution. Moore's activities as a prolific public speaker are documented by a large file of speeches.\n\n Although this collection documents the majority of Moore's professional activities, some of his accomplishments are underrepresented. In particular, this collection does not document the activities of the 1959-1960 Moore Commission, which addressed New York City's fiscal problems.",

He graduated from the Delaware Academy at Delhi. In January 1920, he graduated from the University of Buffalo with the degree of Doctor of Dentistry.\n\n He married Ella Vitt on May 9, 1925, and they had four children. \n\n Before he embarked upon his political career, Senator Bush was a successful dentist. From 1933 to 1937, he served in the New York State Assembly representing Delaware County. In 1957, he was elected to the New York State Senate as a Republican and served until 1965 in the 34th District. For twelve years, he also served as the Delaware County Republican Chairman, but in 1959 he lost that position to Edwyn E. Mason. Bush was a member of the American Legion, Farm Bureau, and the Freemasons. He was the president of the Delaware County Broadcasting Company and of the Council at Delhi Agricultural and Technical Institute (now SUNY Delhi). Bush Hall on the campus of SUNY Delhi is named for him. He was also the director of the First National Bank and Trust Company of Walton, and he was an operator of Station WDLA at Walton.",

He served as an officer on the European front during World War II and during the Korean War. He married Rita Rothmann and together they had three sons and one daughter in Oyster Bay, Long Island.\n\n  A Republican, Curran began his political career as a deputy sheriff and was elected town clerk of Oyster Bay in 1953. Seven years later voters elected him to the New York State Senate representing the Third District, which covers part of Nassau County. During his tenure in the State Senate, he was chairman of the Joint Legislative Committee to Revise Banking Law and a member of the Joint Legislative Committee on Election Law, the committee on Matrimonial and Family Laws, the committee on Penal Institutions, as well as a member of the Education, Finance, Mental Hygiene, Roads and Public Works, Taxation, and Towns and Counties committees. Curran left the State Senate and Governor Nelson Rockefeller appointed him chair the New York State Harness Racing Commission in 1969. He held that post until 1975. \n\n In addition to his public service, Curran was a partner in Curran, Cooney, Penny Agency, Inc., a general insurance firm in Garden City, Long Island. He also was a trustee of the Emigrant Savings Bank.\n\n Curran died in North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, NY on March 13th, 1993.",

In 1904, his family moved to Niagara Falls, New York, where he would later attend public schools. Curto attended the Genesee Wesleyan Preparatory Academy, and then studied at Niagara University and Syracuse University. He received his law degree from the University of Buffalo Law School, and became a member of the New York State Bar Association in 1935. \n\n  Prior to his service in the New York State Assembly, Curto was employed as research counsel for Assemblyman Harry D. Suitor. He served two terms as the acting city and police court judge for the city of Niagara Falls. Curto was also active in various labor, religious (Catholic), and community organizations. \n\n  Curto represented the Second District, which included Niagara County, in the New York State Assembly from 1946-1964. He was elected in a special election held November 6, 1945, following the death of Assemblyman Suitor. He was then re-elected in the general election of 1946. During his almost two decades in the Assembly, he had a number of committee assignments, including: Codes, Rules, Public Service, Ethics and Guidance, and Canals and Waterways. He served as the chair of the Assembly Mortgage and Real Estate Committee. Curto also participated in several joint legislative committees, including: Commerce and Economic Development, Lake Erie-Lake Ontario Canal, and Housing and Urban Redevelopment. \n\n  During his term in office, the New York State Power Authority, under the leadership of Robert Moses, constructed a massive power plant on the Niagara River. As a result of conflicts between the local governments in Niagara County and the Power Authority, Curto took a keen interest in local government matters, including taxes and land annexations. During the later part of his term, he became interested in urban renewal projects, especially in the city of Niagara Falls. Curto was also deeply concerned with labor issues, and he worked tirelessly for the passage of a bill in the Assembly that would ban the practice of employing professional strikebreakers. \n\n Following his retirement from the Assembly in 1965, Curto returned to his private law practice, where he continued to pursue his interest in local labor and urban renewal activities. He retired in 1992. On January 6, 1998, Ernest Curto passed away after a year-long illness. He was survived by his wife, Eleanor, and his three children.",

The papers include Assembly bills and supporting materials, correspondence, and subject files. These materials represent his legislative activities including legislative committee service, correspondence with constituents, organizations, and other legislators and government officials, and his sponsorship of legislation in the Assembly. The types of materials in the collection include letters, brochures, booklets, pamphlets, reports, memos, legislation, statistical data, resolutions, postcards, press clippings, press releases, speeches, hearing transcripts, notes, maps, charts, bound copies of bills, and field notes.\n\n Researchers should note that there is a small amount of material related to his post-legislative career in the collection that dates from 1965, but as it was related to earlier materials in the collection, the archivist chose to retain it.\n\n The series arrangement reflects the way that Curto and his staff organized and filed his papers. The archivist also elected to retain the folder titles created by Curto and his staff. The archivist chose to interfile materials that had been removed from their original folders prior to their arrival at the archives in existing series where appropriate and name them in a manner which corresponded to Curto's other folder names.",

              "content": "James Joseph Delaney was born in New York City on March 19, 1901. He attended public schools in Long Island City, Queens and in 1931 received a law degree from St. John\u2019s University. Between 1936 and 1944, Delaney served as an assistant to the Queens District Attorney\u2019s office. Elected as a Democrat to the Seventy-ninth Congress in November 1944, Delaney was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1946 and resumed his law career thereafter. Delaney\u2019s hiatus from politics was short-lived following his election to the 81 st United States Congress in 1948. Having been reelected to 14 succeeding congresses Delaney served as Congressman from Queens, New York from January 3, 1949 until his retirement on December 31, 1978.\n\n Delaney is noted for his campaign to have cancer-causing agents banned from food, drugs and cosmetics. Passed in 1958, the Delaney Amendment was a clause in the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that outlawed cancer-causing additives in food and commenced the federal government\u2019s role in protecting the public from cancer. His amendment required the Food and Drug Administration to monitor for any chemical additives in food that were found to induce cancer in man or animals. Delaney became involved with this issue as chairman of the Select House Committee that conducted an investigation and study of the use of chemicals, pesticides, and insecticides in and with respect to food products in January 1949 and again in January 1951. In 1996 Congress amended the Delaney Clause with the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) that changed the \u201czero risk\u201d standard, which made no allowances, to one of \u201creasonable certainty.\u201d\n\n Delaney was frequently at odds with fellow Democrats over his votes against federal aid to education, support for public aid to parochial schools, school busing, and his support of the Vietnam War. As chairman of the New York City Congressional delegation in the mid-1970\u2019s, he played a key role in shaping the federal legislation that helped rescue the city from its financial crisis by securing a 2.4 billion dollar low-interest loan. His three decades in Washington catapulted him into the chairmanship of the powerful Committee on Rules in January 1977.\n\n Delaney married Lola Mathis in 1939 and had a son, Patrick. Following his retirement in 1978 James Joseph Delaney was a resident of Key Biscayne, Florida until his death at his son\u2019s home in Tenafly, New Jersey on May 24, 1987. Interment was in Calvary Cemetery, Queens, New York.",

Series 1: Legislative Files is divided into three Sub-series: Sub-series 1: Chemical Additives in Food and Drug contains legislative files, news clippings and correspondence from Delaney\u2019s campaign to have cancer-causing agents banned from food, drugs and cosmetics; Sub-series 2: Education Files focuses on Delaney\u2019s support of Federal Aid for public and private education including the tuition voucher system and consists of news clippings, House Resolution (H.R.) jackets, and correspondence; and Sub-series 3: Subject Files consist of statements, releases, H.R. jackets and correspondence that relate to various political issues of interest to Delaney.\n\n During his terms in Congress Delaney encountered a variety of legislative issues concerning chemical additives in foods and federal aid to education. In January 1949 and again in January 1951, Delaney became chairman of the Select House Committee which conducted an investigation and study of the use of chemicals, pesticides, and insecticides in and with respect to food products. Sub-series 1: Chemical Additives in Food and Drug includes news clippings, publications by Delaney and others, reports, and correspondence all of which are related to the fight against cancer-causing agents in food, drugs, and cosmetics. This series includes documents on antibiotics, asbestos, and fluoridation. Also included are correspondence, endorsements, hearings, releases and speech notes from the Select House Committee.\n\n In 1952, growing concern over funding for private and public education led to Delaney\u2019s involvement in a campaign for federal aid to education. Subseries 2: Education Files, includes correspondence, Congressional files, news clippings, publications, press releases, and statements by Delaney and others . Delaney corresponds with individuals and organizations about aid to private and public education. Notable correspondents include Hugh L. Carey, Cardinal Spellman and the Citizens for Educational Freedom . Delaney\u2019s support for aid to education is well documented through his support of the Junior G.I. bill, a tuition tax credit , and the voucher system. Sub-series 3: Subject Files consist of statements, releases, H.R. jackets and correspondence that relate to other political issues. The folders in this series include H.R. jackets accompanied by correspondence, news clippings, press releases, and statements related to the issue. Each folder in this series concerns a potential legislation and includes related materials for decision makers. Topics include immigration, political prisoners, social security, taxes and much more.\n\n Series 2: Communications includes speeches, statements and press releases given by Delaney and others. We retained a list of all H.R. jackets that Delaney was involved with but have disposed of the originals. As a representative from New York, Delaney had a continuous interaction with the media. Between 1958 and 1978, communication between Delaney\u2019s office and the public were well documented. He issued press releases, speeches, statements, and other communication on many relevant topics . He discussed education, food additives, abortion, social security, the international drug trade and much more. Folders with H.R. jackets include correspondence and Delaney\u2019s notes. Also, Series 1 contains audio and visual material, including an open reel recording and transcript of an August 1957, ABC interview,<emph render=\"italic\"> As We See It</emph>. The collection also includes transcripts of the ABC interview, a June 1962 NBC television and radio broadcast of <emph render=\"italic\">Meet the Press</emph> with Abraham Ribicoff, and an April 1963 CBS broadcast <emph render=\"italic\">The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson</emph>.",

He attended Brown\u2019s Business College in Jamaica, Long Island. Becker enlisted in the United States Army on July 22, 1918 and during World War I served overseas in both England and France. In the 1930s, Becker founded a real-estate and insurance company, and was chairman emeritus of the Board of Directors of the Suburbia Federal Savings and Loan Association in Garden City, Long Island. Becker was an active member in both chapters of Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion in Lynbrook in addition to being a member of the Knights of Columbus. \n\n From 1945-1953, Becker served as a member of the New York State Assembly representing Nassau County, Long Island. Beginning in 1952, Becker acted as the delegate to the Republican National Convention and in November 1952, Becker was elected as a Republican to Congress as a New York State Representative for the 3rd District, serving portions of Nassau County. In Becker\u2019s final term from 1962-1964, congressional district lines were redrawn throughout Nassau County resulting in Becker acting as Representative of the 5th District.\n\n During his terms in office, Becker was part of numerous committees and subcommittees including: Ways and Means Committee, Armed Services Committee (including the Subcommittee of Research and Development), Joint Legislative Committee for the Study of Military Law (specifically 1948-1953), and Charitable and Religions Societies Committee. Towards his later years in office, Becker became vocal and the focus of a debate regarding religion in schools. Becker sponsored a Constitutional amendment to allow Bible readings and organized prayer in public schools with voluntary participation. Following a Supreme Court Decision ruling prayer in school to be unconstitutional, the amendment was defeated. \n\n Becker passed away on September 4, 1981 and is interned at Pine Law National Cemetery, Pinelawn, N.Y. Becker was survived by his wife of 58 years and his three children. One of his children, Francis X Becker was Mayor of Lynbrook and later served as a New York State Supreme Court Justice on Long Island.",

He was the father of Augustus Witschief Bennet, who also served as a U.S. Representative.\n\n Bennet was born in Port Jervis, NY on November 9, 1870. He attended the common schools, graduated from Port Jervis Academy in 1889, and received his law degree from Albany Law School in 1892.\n\n Bennet was a lawyer in private practice, an official reporter of the Orange County Board of Supervisors (1892-1893), a member of the New York State Assembly (1901-1902), a Justice of the Municipal Court of New York City (1903), a member of the United States Immigration Commission (1907-1910), and a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1908 and 1916. He served as a Republican in the 59th through 61st Congresses (March 4, 1905-March 3, 1911) and was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1910. He was elected to the 64th Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of U.S. Representative Joseph A. Goulden (November 2, 1915-March 3, 1917), but was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection to the 65th Congress in 1916. Bennet served as the official parliamentarian of the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1916 and was a United States delegate to the Seventeenth International Congress Against Alcoholism held in Copenhagen in 1923.\n\n From 1920 to 1933 Bennet served as General Counsel to the Edward Hines Lumber Company. During the later 1930s and 1940s he served as a lobbyist and advocate for the lumber industry. He was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the 75th Congress in 1936. That same year Bennet also unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Vice President. He received the nomination in the Oregon primary due to his connection with the lumber industry in that state, but by the time of the national Republican Convention he was no longer considered a viable candidate and lost the nomination to Frank Knox of Illinois. He served as a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention in 1938. He ran unsuccessfully in a special election in 1944 to fill a vacancy in the 78th Congress.\n\n Bennet died on December 1, 1962, in Central Valley, NY. His ashes are interred in Laurel Grove Cemetery in Port Jervis, NY.",

After public school, Hancock attended Wesleyan University in Middletown Connecticut until his graduation in 1906. Hancock graduated from New York Law School in 1908 and was admitted to the bar in the same year. Once he was admitted to the bar, he began to practice law in Syracuse. From 1916-1917, Hancock served as a sergeant with Troop D of the First New York Cavalry, also known as New York National Guard, on the Mexican border. Hancock next served as a lieutenant with the 104th Machine Gun Battalion in the 27th division during World War One. After the armistice in 1918, Hancock was assigned to work as Assistant Division Judge Advocate and promoted to the rank of captain. Hancock continued to serve in the military until 1919.\n\n After finishing his military service, Hancock returned home and became part of the corporation counsel of Syracuse from 1926-1927 and a trustee of Wesleyan University. During this period, Hancock ran in the Republican primary for mayor of Syracuse but lost the nomination. Then, during the 70th Congress, the current representative of the 35th district, Walter W. Magee, died in office leaving his position open. Voters elected Hancock to fill Magee's position in 1927 and he continued to serve as representative of the 35th district until 1945 when there was re-districting. Hancock was then elected as the representative of the 36th district from 1945-1947. While in Congress, Hancock served on the Judicial Committee, Naval Affairs Committee, and Elections No. 1 Committee. Along with this, he was chairman of the speaker's bureau of the Republican Congressional Committee and head of the Eastern Speaker's Bureau in 1936. Hancock was part of the opposition to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal plan.\n\n Hancock did not seek reelection in 1946 for the next session of Congress because of a long time illness and the recommendation of his doctor that he should rest. After leaving Congress, Hancock returned to Syracuse to practice law but died in a hospital in Washington D.C. a year later on January 3, 1948. He was survived by his wife, Emily W. Shonk of Plymouth, Pennsylvania, whom he married in 1912, and son, John S. Hancock, born in 1914. He is buried in Woodland Cemetery in Syracuse.\n\n  The information provided above was gleaned from the following sources",

His collection includes correspondence, newspaper clippings, Congressional bills, transcripts of Congressional hearings, telegrams, and handwritten notes. Much of the correspondence is from constituents and fellow Congressmen, and discusses their opinions about a particular bill and the actions they want taken. The collection covers Hancock's official actions as a New York Congressional Representative from 1933-1946 and does not include personal papers or records of his legislative actions from 1934, 1936, 1938 or 1947. Please note that no papers about Hancock's work outside of Congress or the work he conducted as part of the Naval Affairs or Elections Committees are included in this collection. Some areas of interest in the files include the Equal Rights Amendment, Anti-Trust laws, Submerged Oil Lands, War and Emergency Powers, and Bankruptcy hearings.\n\n The majority of the file names are names that Hancock assigned them based on handwritten slips of paper the archivist found within the original folders in the collection. If there was no paper indicating the file's name, the archivist chose a name based on the subject of the records. All the files are arranged alphabetically. Within the files, items are arranged based on the year of their creation.",

The collection contains correspondence, scrapbooks of newspaper clippings, photographs, printed bills, and legislative transcript materials mostly dating from 1950 to 1964 during his Senate service. A Republican, Hatfield represented the Dutchess County 33rd district from 1948-1954 and 35th district from 1955-1964 in the State Senate. Although he previously served in the New York State Assembly, the collection does not include materials from this tenure. Topics of interest in the collection include documents related to Hatfield's role as chairman of the New York State Commission on Historic Observances and the Social Security bill, which prevented the separation of Social Security from the pensions of retired civil service employees.",

              "content": "Inspired in part by the political activism of the late 1960s, a group of Capital District women coalesced in the early 1970s to establish a small community tied together by feminist ideas. The community included a wide variety of political and social perspectives on women that comprised moderate views as well as ideas of communal living and revolutionary Marxism. This diversity led to a variety of related groups with overlapping membership ranging from state agencies and university Women\u2019s Studies programs to the communally-owned women\u2019s retreat, A Women\u2019s Place. The community also regularly included lesbians who saw their advancement within the larger frameworks of feminism and social justice. These women united together to advocate for a physical support center for the women of the Capital District. The establishment of the Tri-City Women\u2019s Center can be seen as part of a wider shift in the feminist and lesbian groups nationwide away from more radical liberation movements and toward organization-building in an attempt to build women\u2019s culture, community, and shared identity.\n\n In 1972 the city of Albany restored its annual National Women\u2019s Day Festival in Washington Park with the proceeds going towards the establishment of a regional women\u2019s center, yet government support remained more hypothetical then tangible. For a brief period, a space for women was established at 184 Washington Avenue, but most meetings were held in private homes. Funding was almost non-existent and activities were sparse. In October of 1974 a group called \u201cPriorities for Women\u201d rented space at 128 Lancaster Street. The meetings there quickly evolved into the Tri-City Women\u2019s Center, a group striving to establish \u201cA Place of Their Own\u201d \u2013 a community information resource, counseling, and referral center for the women of the Capital District. The center immediately supported a number of women\u2019s groups in the area including Speakout, Albany Women Against Rape (AWARE), Lesbians for Liberation, the Women\u2019s Counseling Collective, the Albany chapter of the National Organization of Women (NOW), and the Radical Feminist Study Group, among others.\n\n The success of the Tri-City Women\u2019s Center lasted only a few months, as the Center Square Neighborhood Association objected to the establishment of a non-residential facility on Lancaster Street. The neighborhood had been particularly defensive of its residential status since the construction of Empire State Plaza reduced its size. The Association had recently halted the construction of a parking garage on State Street and a McDonalds on South Swan Street and had opposed the special use applications of a number of charitable organizations attempting to move into the area. The Tri-City Women\u2019s Building violated zoning laws by failing to file a special use application with the city planner and for having only one exit. The group was forced to leave by April 1975, despite petitioning for a special use permit with the support of 270 neighborhood residents.\n\n Next, the Tri-City Women\u2019s Center soon settled in the basement of the YWCA at 5 Lodge Street where it offered a large meeting room and a few offices, yet suffered from a lack of public visibility. A governing structure was established with a Steering Committee and eight working committees tasked with staffing and scheduling, legal procedures, financing and fundraising, programming, maintenance, library, and publicity duties. The Center was mainly supported by donations and monthly pledges which prevented it from providing a wealth of programs. However, the center was staffed by volunteers who provided much-needed information for the area\u2019s women and the center began to build a library and a resource file. Perhaps the most successful program of this period was a biweekly women\u2019s coffeehouse which featured feminist musicians and other entertainers. Although the Tri-City Women\u2019s Center hosted a number of politically-oriented groups that often overlapped in leadership with the Center, the Center itself attempted to be apolitical. This enabled the center and its occupants to maintain their political diversity, and practical mission of providing space, support, and information.\n\n In early 1977 the YWCA sold the building at 5 Lodge Street and moved to a smaller facility. The Tri-City Women\u2019s center moved to 132 Central Avenue where it enlarged its library and maintained popular programs such as the coffeehouse. After losing its lease on Central Avenue, the Center resided briefly on Lark Street before moving to share the building at 196 Morton Avenue where it continued to struggle with financial instability.\n\n 1982 was a major breakthrough for the Tri-City Women\u2019s Center when a group of local feminists established Holding Our Own, a foundation dedicated to funding feminist and social justice organizations in the Capital District. The Tri-City Women\u2019s Center received a $16,000 grant from Holding Our Own to organize and raise funds to purchase a building to act as owned permanent space for women\u2019s organizations and programs. In 1984 a large meeting established a new organizational structure and a new name. The Tri-City Women\u2019s Center became the Women\u2019s Building Project with a central Executive Committee and a wider Coordinating Council that also included the leadership from the eight major task forces and a handful of representatives elected from the memberships as a whole. The eight standing task forces were Finance, Public Relations, Outreach, Advocacy, Program, Newsletter, and Maintenance, with many featuring the input of new volunteers. The new structure also included a quarterly meeting of all members that reflected part of its new fundraising model, paid memberships. These fees, like the program costs for attendees, were readily flexible based upon a member\u2019s ability to pay in keeping with the organization\u2019s advocacy of wider social justice and service to the underprivileged. The Women\u2019s Building Project moved briefly to the basement of a Society of Friends meetinghouse on Madison Avenue before renting a small storefront at 141 Madison. New members were gathered with a series of large conferences and community brunches.\n\n In February of 1987, Holding Our Own created a formal Feasibility Committee tasked with outlining the path to purchase a building. This committee featured representatives from Holding Our Own and the Women\u2019s Building Project, as well as local women experienced in financial planning and real estate. The relationship between the two groups was fairly natural since a number of important women, such as Winnie DeLoayza and Maud Easter, led both organizations. After reviewing nine locations, Holding Our Own agreed to provide the downpayment for the $149,000 cost of 79 Central Avenue in June, provided that the Women\u2019s Building Project would make the mortgage payments, pay all operating costs, and raise almost $350,000 for the necessary renovations. The Project became just the Women\u2019s Building when it moved into 79 Central Avenue in October 1987 and began a large multi-year Capital Campaign to fund the renovations with the help of consultants experienced in non-for-profit fundraising. The first stage of renovations was completed in 1989, when in February the Women\u2019s Building celebrated its Grand Opening and welcomed in its first tenants.\n\n By 1988 the Women\u2019s Building had hired a full-time Building Coordinator and greatly expanded its educational, recreational, and cultural programming and broadened its information and referral services. Early tenants included The Capital Region Association of Eating Disorders, a teen pregnancy programming, a counseling center, the National Abortion Rights Action League, and the National Conference of Puerto Rican Women. Organizations such as the Albany chapter of the National Women\u2019s Organization, The Capital District Women\u2019s Political Caucus, and the Women\u2019s Bar Association used the building for meetings, mail, and answering machines, and support groups for bisexual women, alcoholic women, and incest and rape victims found a safe space for their meetings in the building.\n\n After the early renovations, the building still lacked an elevator which would provide handicapped access to all floors. In keeping with the organizational mission of promoting social justice, installing an elevator became a priority and the Women\u2019s Building applied for funding from the New York State Legislature. In February of 1988, State Assemblyman Paul Tomko requested that the State provide the Women\u2019s Building with a $40,000 grant. The proposal became publicly controversial and Republican opponent Bob Lansing made the grant a primary campaign issue, opposing the funding of \u201c\u2026a radical feminist and lesbian center\u2026\u201d Tomko was easily re-elected yet funding for the elevator was not awarded and the Women\u2019s Building continued to apply for grants, with an elevator reaching two of the building\u2019s three stories by 1995.\n\n Despite the success of the late 1980s and the considerable funding from memberships and the Capital Campaign, the Women\u2019s Building found itself in a self-described \u201cfinancial crisis\u201d by 1995. Programing and utility expenses rose sharply into the 1990s, and the $134,000 1994 budget left the Women\u2019s Building over $14,000 in the red. Despite returning its final $50,000 startup loan payment to Holding Our Own in December 1991, the Women\u2019s Building was unable to make a $2,000 loan payment to its sister organization in June of 1995 and failed to meet payroll in July. The building was forced to cut Deanne Grimaldi, its full-time coordinator, in August of that year and substantially reduce its liability insurance coverage, among other measures. A Building Feasibility Committee was established to reexamine the need and viability of the organizations central mission: a permanent, owned space. The committee reaffirmed the viability of owning 79 Central Avenue and restructured the physical building and its programming to better uphold its goals in a more financially sustainable way. Holding Our Own forgave and delayed loan payments and capital from bank loans helped the organization stay afloat into the 2000s.\n\n The Women\u2019s Building has provided a physical space for Capital District women for 40 years. From its 1970s beginnings the organization sought to provide a safe space for lesbians, minority women, and other discriminated women and a foster a sense of community and identity through educational and informational services along with cultural programming. The Women\u2019s Building became a haven for lesbians, victims of rape and domestic abuse, and other women struggling to understand themselves. Perhaps its most important contribution was information: the building held literature and programs on everything from financial planning and legal issues to parenthood, childbirth, and women\u2019s health issues. Despite being formed out of feminist and lesbian rights groups, the Women\u2019s Building aimed to be as apolitical as possible while providing space for a variety of politically-minded groups. Through its history, the organization provide resources\u2014space, information, access\u2014for a diverse variety of social justice and activist groups and individuals in need, while its programming had a more general goal of promoting women\u2019s culture, community, and shared identity.",

The festival is known as Pinxter, Pinxter Sunday or Pinkster, Dutch for Pentecost, and as Whitsuntide, the English term for Pentecost.\n\n During the colonial period, Pinxter celebrations were held throughout eastern New York in communities of Dutch origins. Africans played a major role in organizing Pinxter, adding African music and dance to the festivities. In 1811 the Common Council of the City of Albany passed a Whitsuntide Holiday law which banned the essential elements of the festival and, as a result, the festival died out. \n\n In 1971, Pinxter was revived in Albany and celebrated on Sundays during Tulip Fest in Washington Park with craft vendors and musicians. It was often advertised as an illegal festival. Wolcott wrote several letters asking the 1811 law be repealed. The Whitsuntide Holiday Law was repealed in 2011, two hundred years after it was enacted.",

Among Congressman Boehlert's many achievements was his chairmanship of the House Science Committee; he also served on committees on Transportation and Infrastructure. By appointment of the Speaker of the House, Congressman Boehlert served for eight years as a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, where he was on the front line of important intelligence decisions faced by Congress. Early in 2003, the Speaker appointed Boehlert to serve on the newly created Select Committee on Homeland Security. In addition to being a leader on science issues, Boehlert's legislative experience and seniority made him one of the most influential Members of Congress. National Journal featured him as one of a dozen \"key players\" in the House. Time Magazine highlighted Congressman Boehlert as a power center on Capitol Hill. Congressional Quarterly regularly named Boehlert one of the 50 most effective lawmakers in Washington.",

Through these methods the NCADP hopes to eliminate the death penalty in the United States and supports efforts to abolish the death penalty worldwide.\n\n The NCADP was founded in 1976 following the <emph render=\"italic\">Gregg v. Georgia</emph> Supreme Court decision, which reinstated the death penalty in the United States. Two American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) staff members, Deborah Leavy and Henry Schwarzchild, gathered a group of anti-capital punishment advocates one week after the <emph render=\"italic\">Gregg</emph> decision. The organization that resulted brought together 26 affiliate organizations to coordinate their actions at the national level. The NCADP began its life housed within the ACLU offices in New York. Shortly after 1982 the group relocated to Philadelphia and, in 1987, moved to its current location in Washington D.C.\n\n As a Washington based advocacy group, the NCADP lobbies against capital punishment through a variety of methods that include organizing protests and increasing public awareness. The NCADP uses a number of non-violent methods to draw attention to, and advance, their campaign at local, state and national levels.\n\n Since its inception, the NCADP has been working to educate and inform the public about the failings and inconsistencies of the death penalty. The NCADP\u2019s campaign against capital punishment hinges on four core areas of advocacy: legislative, media, grassroots, and human rights. These efforts are accomplished through an annual conference, distribution of national publications such as <emph render=\"italic\">LifeLines</emph>, the newsletter of the NCADP, and the <emph render=\"italic\">National Execution Alert Network</emph>, a system which provides updates on pending executions. Founded in 1984, the Alert Network is a tracking and warning project keyed to executions \u2013 directing when and what actions should be taken in protest. Since 1981, the NCADP has hosted an annual conference which brings abolitionists from across the country together to analyze the past years successes and shortcomings and to strategize the goals and objectives for the coming year. Additionally, the NCADP compiles statistics and publishes findings on a variety of subjects concerning the death penalty including <emph render=\"italic\">The Abolitionist Directory</emph>, a national listing of every organization and individual working against capital punishment and <emph render=\"italic\">The Death Penalty Exchange</emph>, a handbook for organizers.\n\n The NCADP has achieved recent victories in its struggle to end capital punishment. Through the efforts of its <emph render=\"italic\">Stop Killing Kids Campaign</emph>, an initiative that sought to bring an end to the death penalty for offenders whose crimes were committed while they were under the age of 18, NCADP was successful in ending the death penalty as punishment for juveniles in several states. In 2006 NCADP successfully fought death penalty reinstatement efforts in Wisconsin, and the group has played a significant role in winning clemency for several death row inmates.",

In addition, Lombardi served as a member of the Codes, Education, Judiciary, Rules, and Veterans committees. During his career, Lombardi was known for his healthcare efforts, as well as advocating for medical malpractice reform. He was chairman of the State Council on Healthcare Financing, and a member of the Assembly on the Legislature, Human Resources and Arts, Tourism, and Cultural Resources committees of the Executive Committee of the National Conference of State Legislatures. Lombardi was a member of the Council of State Governments and chairman of its Committee on Human Resources.\n\n During his career, Lombardi received a number of awards including the Terence Cardinal Cooke Award, Legislator of the Year from the National Association for Homecare, the Arents Medal, and the Simon LeMoyne Medal.

He maintained a law practice throughout his life.\n\n A Democrat, Podell became a member of the New York State Assembly representing Kings County in 1955 and served 14 years in the 170th through 177th New York State Legislatures. In 1968 constituents elected him to the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election for the 13th Congressional District (Brooklyn). He was re-elected to Congress three more times and served until 1975. Podell was an unsuccessful candidate for re-nomination by his party in 1974.\n\n Toward the end of his Congressional career, Podell was indicted and ultimately plead guilty to bribery charges. He served several months in jail and then returned to his law firm where he spent the remainder of his years. Podell died of kidney failure at the age of 79 on August 25, 2005 in New York.",

From 1951-1958 he served as a New York State Assistant District Attorney, obtaining the title of Chief Assistant by 1958. He served as District Attorney of Suffolk County from 1962-1965. \n\n In 1965 voters of the 2nd District (part of Suffolk County), elected Smith, a Republican, to represent them in the New York State Senate. During his early years as a State Senator Smith focused on the debate surrounding the question of whether or not to legalize abortion in New York, on creating legislation that would help provide better educational services for mentally handicapped students, and for revising and updating penal codes and laws in an attempt to deal with crime in the state. Smith also began to introduce legislation to protect the environment, which became the main focus of his work in later years.\n\n By the end of his Senate career in 1978, Smith had chaired the Conservation Committee and helped to found the Adirondack Park Agency and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. From 1978-1990 Smith served as the commissioner of the State Investigation Committee.\n\n Smith was married to the former Elizabeth Reynolds for 44 years and they had five children. In 1993 at the age of 70, Smith passed away from an inoperable brain tumor.",

In Series 1, Subject Files, the topics with the largest amount of information are abortion, education (especially special education), medical treatment and penal codes. The abortion files contain a significant number of opinions of New York citizens (in the form of correspondence and formal testimony) at the time New York\u2019s abortion laws were being reconsidered. The education files include materials on debates surrounding busing to questions about decentralization and funding. Materials pertaining to medical treatment range from provision of Medicaid to improvement of New York State's mental health resources. The files on penal codes contain information about penal laws and institutions, and there are other related subject files on issues of crime in general.\n\n The Smith Papers contain an abundant amount of Smith\u2019s correspondence with his constituents. Researchers who are interested in studying public opinion on issues of abortion, education, medicine, penal law, and environmental protection in the late 1960s will find ample materials in this collection. \n\n While there are materials in Series 1 that relate to environmental conservation, there are no materials that directly pertain to the creation of the Adirondack Park Agency or the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, which were developed after 1969. There are, however, individual subject files that pertain to certain specific conservation issues such as the Conservation Bill of Rights and regulation of game fishing. \n\n Series 2, Bills, contains files pertaining to each of the bills that Smith introduced in the State Senate in 1968.\n\n Please note that there also are background materials in Series 1 which Smith referenced while a State Senator that date to 1963-1964.",

In 1966 Volker served an additional year in the New York Assembly as the Republician representative from Erie County 162nd district.

              "content": "Dr. Bernard Vonnegut was born in 1914 in Indianapolis, Indiana to architect Kurt Vonnegut, Sr. (1884-1957) and Edith Sophia Lieber (d. 1944). He had two younger siblings; a sister, Alice (1917-1958), and a brother, Kurt (1922-2007), the 20th Century author famous for his works of satire and science fiction. Bernard Vonnegut attended public elementary schools, Shortridge High School and the Park School which he graduated from in 1932. From there he attended MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in Chemistry in 1936 and a doctorate in Physical Chemistry in 1939.\n\n After receiving his PhD, Vonnegut went to work for the Hartford Empire Company where he conducted research on surface properties and the breaking stress of glass. He worked there for two years before returing to MIT as a research associate. During his time as a research associate, Vonnegut worked in the Chemical Engineering Department as well as the Meteorology Department. His research in the Chemical Engineering Department focused on aerosol generation, filtration, and measurement while in the Meteorological Department he researched icing of aircrafts, the adhesion of ice, and the properties of supercooled clouds.\n\n In 1945, Vonnegut left MIT once again and went to work for GE Research Labortories. At first he worked in the chemistry group where he focused on the supercooling of liquid tin metals but then was moved to another department. In his new position, Vonnegut worked alongside Nobel laureate Dr. Irving Langmuir, and Vincent J. Schaefer, the original discoverer of cloud seeding via dry ice. With Langmuir and Schaefer, Vonnegut worked on cloud seeding and problems related to cloud physics as well as Project Cirrus, a weather modification program. Research on Project Cirrus was done in conjunction with the United States Signal Corps, Office of Naval Research, and the United States Air Force. General oversight was handled by the Department of Defense. The objective of the project was to find ways to artificially influence precipitation. Work on this project, as well as the science of artificial precipitation, was strongly influenced by Vonnegut\u2019s discovery of AgI, Silver Iodide, as a superior nucleation agent. This method became the chief method of \u201crain making.\u201d Along with his discovery of AgI as a nucleation agent, Vonnegut also devised intruments for measuring the true air temperature from an airplane, known as the vortex thermometer, and an automatic condensation nucei meter for measuring aerosols.\n\n Dr. Vonnegut left GE in 1952 for a position with the management consultant angency Arthur D. Little where he continued research in atmospheric science and aerosols. His atmospheric science research was done in partnership with Charles Moore; their work was focused on atmospheric electricity and cloud physics. While at Arthur D. Little, Dr. Vonnegut also participated in research on the problems associated with the measurement and production of aerosols, the miniaturization of electrical recorders, the hazards of electrostatic in industry, glass fiber formation, and the behavior of evaporating electrified droplets. Much of the reaearch and experiments that Vonnegut conducted at Arthur Little were not done purely for research purposes but done because of contracts the company had with public and private agencies.\n\n After 15 years with Arthur D. Little, Dr. Vonnegut moved on to the newly created Atmospheric Sciences Research Center at the State University of New York at Albany under the direction of Vincent Schaefer. Vonnegut was hired as a senior research scientist and looked at electrification in thunderstorms, the role of electricity in precipitation formation, and kinetic nucleation. Along with his research position, Vonegut also held an academic appointment in which he taught classes on atmospheric electricity, atmospheric instrumentation, and atmospheric chemistry. During his time at SUNY Albany, Vonnegut received several awards. In 1976, he was awarded the American Meteorological Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Advancement of Applied Meteoroloy. The following year, he recieved the Weather Modification Association Vincent J. Schaefer Award. Along with these awards, Vonnegut was named a Distinguished Research Professor in 1984 and, upon his formal retirement in 1985, was named Professor Emeritus.\n\n One of Dr. Vonnegut\u2019s most notable projects during his time at SUNY Albany was his collaboration with NASA on the Night/Day Optical Survey of Lightning (NOSL) experiments. Astronauts, equipped with specialized recording instruments, took pictures and video of large thunderstorms over the course of three shuttle missions. Dr. Vonnegut, who proposed the project, utilized the photographs and data in his continuing research on thunderstorms and electrification theory.\n\n Throughout his career, Dr. Vonnegut pursued research in many fields of interest; mainly thunderclouds, tornadoes, and lightning. He made regular summer expeditions to New Mexico where he worked with colleagues at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro to study these phenomena, and many of the experiments he undertook pertain to these three topics. Furthermore, Dr. Vonnegut accumulated multiple patents for his inventions and research techniques. \n\n Dr. Vonnegut married Lois Bowler (d. 1972) and had five sons. Interestingly, after becoming a father, he took on a personal campaign to improve the quality of educational science texts and encyclopedias, as well as truth in advertising regarding scientific claims on children\u2019s products.\n\n Dr. Vonnegut continued atmospheric research and publishing until his death from cancer at 82 in 1997.",

Little Corporation, and the State University of New York at Albany's Atmospheric Sciences Research Center and Department of Atmospheric Sciences. The collection spans from 1828 his death in 1997. The earliest materials in the collection are reprints of articles that he referenced for his research.\n\n The records in this collection document Dr. Vonnegut's research interests. These interests include icing and atmospheric electricity, cloud physics, thunderstorms, and tornado formation. The collection also contain extensive information about his major scientific discoveries and experiments, such as Project Cirrus, a program that sought ways to artificially influence precipitation, the NASA/NOSL project where he studied weather phenomena from space, and his experiments and research in New Mexico. Additionally, a small amount of personal records are interspersed in the collection.\n\n The collection is arranged into 11 series. The records consist of technical memoranda, research, data, inventions and patent forms, equipment specifications, drawings, figures, handwritten notes, manuscripts, reports, correspondence, publicity materials, course materials, news clippings, photographs, memorabilia, and audio/video materials. The majority of materials date from Dr. Vonnegut\u2019s tenure at GE, Arthur D. Little, and State University of New York at Albany.\n\n All series are arranged alphabetically and reflect Dr. Vonnegut's own filing system. Since the original order was maintained, correspondence is kept with other materials, such as reports and technical memorandum, when they were found together. If the correspondence was found in a seperate place than the materials it was originally meant to be paired with, there was not an effort to reunite the materials. Copies of reports and memorandum may be found in multiple locations.\n\n For related materials, please see the following collections held by the ME Grenander Department of Special Collection and Archives: Atmospheric Sciences Research Center Records (UA-450), which includes many publications and articles issued by the ASRC, Duncan Blanchard Papers (UA-902.065), Raymond Falconer Papers (UA-902.014) and Vincent J.

Founded by Vincent Schaefer, a General Electric protge of Nobel Prize winner Irving Langmuir, ASRCs world-class researchers study the physical and chemical nature of the atmosphere and apply that knowledge to explore the interaction of chemical, physical, geological and biological processes that impact our environment. Through technology transfer and collaboration with state, federal and industrial partners, ASRC enhances New York States scientific capacity and infrastructure, while advancing the quality of life and economic well-being of its citizens. ASRC is currently located in the CESTM (Center for Emerging Sciences &amp; Technology Management) of the SUNY Albany campus. Research and development at ASRC spans a broad spectrum of scientific areas, including: advanced sensor development; laboratory and field experiments in atmospheric chemistry, atmospheric physics, and aerosol microphysics; remote sensing of the environment; global aerosol forecasting, air quality, climate change, and dispersion modeling; and high performance computing, scientific computing, and visual analytics.",
